Adela ridingsella,species,wikipedia.org,"Adela ridingsella,  Ridings' fairy moth, is a moth of the Adelidae family or fairy longhorn moths. It was described by James Brackenridge Clemens in 1864. It is widespread in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Maine to Pennsylvania and the mountains of North Carolina. Adults are on wing from June to July.
Larvae found in petiole galls on Parthenocissus quinquefolia might belong to this species. The larvae later formed external cases.

Druentica inscita,species,wikipedia.org,"Druentica inscita is a moth of the family Mimallonidae. It is native to Mexico, and was thought to have been introduced to Hawaii for biological control of Clidemia hirta. However, recent research has suggested that the species introduced to Hawaii was misidentified, and is now known to be Druentica coralie (Herbin, 2016).
The larvae cut and fold the leaves of Clidemia hirta and Miconia acinodendrum to form a feeding shelter. They are green with brown stripes and are about 50 mm long.

Megalopyge opercularis,species,wikipedia.org,"The inch-long larva is generously coated in long, luxuriant hair-like setae, making it resemble a tiny Persian cat, the characteristic that presumably gave it the name ""puss."" It is variable in color, from downy, grayish white to golden brown to dark, charcoal gray. It often has a streak of bright orange running longitudinally. The ""fur"" on early-stage larvae is sometimes extremely curly, giving them a cottony, puffed-up look. The body tapers to a tail that extends well beyond the body, unlike its relative M. crispata. The middle instar has a more disheveled, ""bad-hair-day"" appearance, without a distinctive tail. The ""fur"" of the larva contains venomous spines that cause extremely painful reactions in human skin upon contact. The adult moth is covered in long fur in colors ranging from dull orange to lemon yellow, with hairy legs and fuzzy black feet.  The cocoons that these caterpillars emerge from vary in size from 1.3 to 2.0 centimeters and contain small hair pockets on the back and flattened front end, the latter covering the operculum at least until it is completely formed.",1095

Eutachyptera psidii,species,wikipedia.org,"Eutachyptera is a monotypic moth genus in the family Lasiocampidae. The genus was erected by William Barnes and James Halliday McDunnough in 1912. Its single species, Eutachyptera psidii, was first described by Sallé in 1857. It is found in Mexico.  


== Behaviour ==
The caterpillars feed on the leaves of guava (Psidium sp.) and oak.  They live communally in large silken nests, which can extend to 50 centimetres (20 in) or more in length.  They remain in the nests by day and leave at night to feed, laying a trail of pheromones to help them and their nest-mates navigate to and from feeding areas.
Unusually among caterpillars, E. psidii larvae can remain active for as long as 18 days with no food, which they may have to do when their host trees lose their leaves in winter.


== Use of larvae and silk ==
The larvae are among the caterpillars traded and eaten in Mexico.
The silk nests were used by the Aztecs, Mixtecs and Zapotecs to make a paper-like fabric, which was a commercial item at the time of Moctezuma.  Later, the Mixtec and other communities in Oaxaca extracted the silk fibres from the nests and wove them into sashes. This practise had ceased by 1997.


== Synonyms ==
The US National Center for Biotechnology Information lists the following synonyms for E. psidii:

Bombyx psidii
Gloveria psidii
Lasiocampa psidii
Metanastria psidii

Hyblaea puera,species,wikipedia.org,"Hyblaea puera, the teak defoliator, is a moth and cryptic species complex native to South Asia and South-east Asia. It was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1777. The species has also been recently reported to be present in Central America and Africa. The caterpillar feeds on teak and other trees. It is considered to be one of the major teak pests around the world.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Hyblaea puera occurs in forests across southern Asia from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, through Thailand and the rest of south-east Asia to New Guinea, and north Queensland in Australia. Recent reports place it in Guadeloupe, and Suriname.


== Life cycle ==
The adult moths are comparatively small, with a wingspan of 3–4 cm, and have a characteristic resting posture that conceals the black and orange-yellow hindwings under the greyish-brown forewings. Males and females emerge more or less simultaneously and mating takes place within a couple of days. Eggs are laid on tender new leaves, placed singly near the veins, and usually on the undersurface. They are oval, flat, and white and measure about 1 mm in length. About 500 eggs are laid per female with a recorded maximum of 1000. Larvae hatch in about two days. There are five larval instars. The first and second instars mainly feed on the leaf surface. Starting with the third instar, the larva cuts out a leaf flap, usually at the edge of the leaf, folds it over, fastens it with silk, and feeds from within. The entire leaf, excluding the major veins of tender leaves, is eaten, but more veins are left in older leaves. Under the optimal conditions, the larval period lasts 10 to 12 days. The full-grown larva measures about 3.5–4.5 cm, and there is considerable colour variation in the fourth and fifth instars; the body may be either wholly black or dark greyish to black, with longitudinal coloured bands which may include a dorsal orange or ocherous band and lateral white lines. A recent study revealed the existence of density-dependent colour polyphenism and resistance build-up against invading baculovirus by H. puera larvae. The mature larvae descend to the ground on silken threads and pupate under a thin layer of leaf litter or soil, within loosely built cocoons made of dry or decayed leaves, or soil particles held together with silk. Pupation may some times occur within green leaves of other plants in the under growth, folded or juxtaposed with silk. On Avicennia plants the caterpillars pupate inside the cases made out of the host plant leaves themselves. It is probably an adaptive trait acquired by the species for surviving in the hostile mangrove environment, since pupation is not possible in the muddy and inundated soils of mangroves. The average pupal period lasts six to eight days under optimal conditions. There is no evidence of hibernation or aestivation of the pupa.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Temporal and spatial dynamics ==

The teak defoliator is present year round in teak plantations, but in varying population densities. During the period of natural defoliation of teak (November, December, and January), the pest density is very low (endemic). Every year high-intensity outbreaks of teak defoliator occur immediately after the premonsoon showers in late February or early march in Kerala. These centres are highly localized outbreaks which represent the transitional stage between very sparse endemic population and high density outbreak population. These centres will be 5,000 to 15,000 square metres in area and are characterized by heavy tree top infestation. The months of April, May, June, and July witness a series of large outbreaks. During late July or September, the population declines to the endemic level. In some years, there will be fresh outbreaks during October. From then on until the next year, the population remains at the endemic level.


== Natural control ==


=== Parasitoids ===
The main parasitoids attacking teak defoliator include the tachinid Palexorisa solennis, a eulophid Sympiesis hyblaeae, the chalicid Brachymeria lasus and the three ichneumonids, Eriborus gardneri, Stictopisthus sp. and Echthromorpha agrestoria notulatoria. B. lasus is a pupal parasitoid and all others are larval parasitoids. The overall parasitism by all species is about 9%.


=== Predators ===
Wasps, spiders, birds, and bonnet macaques eat H. puera. Forty-eight species of birds have been recorded as feeding on teak defoliator larvae during large-scale outbreaks.


=== Pathogens ===
The bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens are identified as causing mortality to the teak defoliator. A synnematous fungus of the genus Hirsutella is found to be pathogenic to this pest. An absolutely specific virus with refractile polyhedral inclusion bodies, staining blue in Giemsa and thick blue in Buffalo Black, named as Hyblaea puera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HpNPV) is found to be very effective in the biological control of this pest.


== Hyblaea puera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HpNPV) ==
Large-scale deaths of teak defoliator larvae characterized by cessation of feeding, flaccidity and subsequent liquefaction of body tissues have been reported by Stebbing as early as 1903. During 1985, an investigation of microbial pathogens of H. puera was undertaken in the plantations of Nilambur Forest Divisions of Kerala, India, by KFRI detected several dead insects with the characteristic symptoms as observed by Stebbing. Microscopic observation of tissues revealed the presence of refractile polyhedral inclusions bodies, which stained blue in Giemsa, measured 0.9–2.4 micrometers in diameter in the scanning electron micrograph taken by Jean Adams at USDA, confirmed its identity as NPV. The NPVs come under the family of baculoviridae and its virions are enveloped rod shaped nucleocapsids containing circular, supercoiled, double stranded DNA.


=== Mode of action ===

The NPV which enters the insect gut, lyses in the alkaline environment of the midgut, releasing virions. Virions invade the columnar cells of midgut epithelium and integrate DNA into the nucleus of midgut cells. Later the viral DNA takes over control of the cellular machinery to reproduce itself. The ECVs which are the progenies released into the haemocoel from the midgut cells are more infectious than the PIBs and mediate disease spread within the insect body. A rapid spread of infection in the insect body leads immediately to cessation of feeding and later on, to death. Even in the fully mature larvae, HpNPV can kill in 60–72 hours, making it one of the fastest acting insect viruses.
The discovery of virus disease on H. puera was a major breakthrough in the teak defoliator management research.


== As food ==
The teak moth, in Indonesia known as entung jati, is commonly eaten in the regions where they thrive. They are usually caught for consumption at the cocoon stage, at which point they are easily collected from the ground. This serves as an essential, readily accessible source of protein for the villagers, commonly farmers, around these areas.

Euclea gajentaani,species,wikipedia.org,"Euclea gajentaani is a moth in the family Limacodidae (the slug caterpillar moths). The species was first described by entomologists Marc Epstein and Jorge Corrales in 2004. The species was named for Henricus Gajentaan, Ambassador of the Netherlands to Costa Rica.


== Range ==
Euclea gajentaani has only been observed in Costa Rica between 700 and 1200m on the Caribbean slope.


== Life cycle ==


=== Larva ===
This is a colorful yellow-green caterpillar with five oval spots on its back, with patches of spines typical of Euclea caterpillars.


=== Adult ===
Euclea gajentaani is a red-brown moth with a forewing length of 10.5–12.0mm in males and 16.0mm in females. Adults of Euclea gajentaani cannot be separated from Euclea diversa without dissection and analysis of genitalia, though the two species seem to be allopatric.


== Host plants ==
This species has been found feeding on a variety of plants including Ocotea insularis, Andira inermis, Machaerium acuminatum, Inga oerstediana, and Quassia amara.

Euclea delphinii,species,wikipedia.org,"The spiny oak slug (Euclea delphinii) is the larval form (caterpillar) of a moth in the family Limacodidae.


== Life cycle ==
There is one generation a year in most of the northern parts of its range, with caterpillars seen from late June to October (Wagner 2005). Two generations or more from Missouri south.


=== Egg ===
Eggs are laid singly or in small clusters on leaves (Wagner 2005).


=== Larva ===

Euclea delphinii is the only species of its genus to exist in West Virginia (USDA 2022). Euclea caterpillar larvae are variable in colour, with the most common colouration being yellowish green, with bright red, square subdorsal markings- making this a distinct ID feature for this species. Orange hues are also common, alongside the red square subdorsal markings.The larva is flattened and ovoid in outline, with spiny tubercules along the back and sides. These are venomous, producing symptoms in humans that vary from mild itching and burning to more serious reactions that require medical attention (Florida Poison Information Center 2015). The sides have craters ringed with black or white along them. This species has 8 instars in total, with the first instar being a small, whitish larva with subdorsal tubercules. In the final instar they usually have two to four sets of black hairs at the tail end, that can fall off, called 'caltrop' spines after the Roman defensive weapons.  Colourful, but the colours vary enormously (Wagner 2005). with orange, green, lichen and orange-green Florida forms also recorded, although less common (USDA 2022). Like all limacodids, the legs are shortened and the prolegs are reduced to suction cups. Maximum length, 20 mm (Wagner 2005).


=== Pupa ===
Pupates in a cup-shaped cocoon with a circular escape hatch.


=== Adult ===

The small (1 cm) moth is 'hairy' and brown, with green patches on the upper wing. The underwing is a paler grey-brown.


=== Parasitoids ===
A number of parasitoids have been recorded on spiny oak slug caterpillars, including tachinid flies (Uramya pristis; Austrophorocera einaris; Compsilura concinnata), eulophid wasps (Platyplectrus americana; Pediobius crassicornis), and braconid wasps (Cotesia empretiae; Triraphis discoideus). An egg parasitoid of genus Trichogramma was also recorded.(Gates et al 2012)


=== Phenology of Caterpillar ===
The caterpillar distribution varies, most notably from June to October. With the adults appearing in April to September. Overall, this species' range is from East Minnesota to Maine and New Brunswick all the way to where it's most commonly found, in West Virginia. Male populations also outnumber female populations drastically (USDA 2022).
There is one generation of caterpillars per year in most of the Eastern U.S., mostly being active from late June to October. 2 generations of caterpillars occur in Missouri and the Deep South, where there are more presumed to be in this area (Wagner 2005).


=== Look Alikes/Species Confusion ===
Euclea delphinii caterpillars are often confused with other caterpillars from their genus, particularly Parasa spp. This confusion is mostly due to the brown and green coloration in the adult moths. Upon closer inspection, however, the two species can be distinguished: Parasa spp. has a larger green patch on its forewings, while Euclea delphinii features smaller green spots and more brown on its forewings. Most of this confusion occurs outside of West Virginia, where many forewings appear predominantly green. To help with accurate identification, focusing on the thorax is key. Euclea delphinii has a brown thorax, setting it apart from the green thorax of Parasa spp. (USDA 2022).


== Food plants ==
Eats a variety of deciduous trees and shrubs, not limited to: apple, ash, basswood, beech, birch, blueberry, cherry, chestnut, hackberry, hickory, maple, oak, poplar, sycamore and willow (Wagner 2005).

Peridroma saucia,species,wikipedia.org,"The variegated cutworm can be found in North and South America, the Hawaiian Islands, Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The origin of the moth is uncertain, but the earliest records with the description of the moth are from Europe in 1790. However, the moth was first observed in North America in 1841, where today it primarily inhabits Southern Canada and Northern United States. P. saucia was discovered in Japan in the 1970s, where it is dubbed ""nise-tamanayaga"", which directly translates to ""false black cutworm moth"". As Japanese populations of the variegated cutworm continue to grow, studies are still being conducted to identify the distribution areas in the region.",673

Spodoptera eridania,species,wikipedia.org,"Spodoptera eridania (Southern armyworm) is a moth that is known to be a pest. They are one of the most important defoliators in the tropical and subtropical regions of the western hemisphere that feed heavily on plants while they are young, often resulting in skeleton leaves on their food plants. They are also heavy feeders on tomato in Florida. There is a lot of development in producing pesticides against the S. eridania, specifically a neem-based pesticide that can result in smaller and prolonged development. The wingspan is 33–38 mm. Adults are on wing year-round. The larvae feed on various weeds but prefer Amaranthus species and Phytolacca americana.


== Geographic range ==
The S. eridania is found in North America (the southern US states as far west as Kansas and New Mexico), through the Caribbean and Central America into South America (through Brazil to Argentina). It has been introduced Nigeria and Cameroon.


== Food resources ==


=== Host plants ===
The plants that the armyworm feeds on include a wide range of important vegetables, fruits, and crops. The vegetables include beet, cabbage, carrot, collard, cowpea, eggplant, okra, pepper, potato, sweet potato, tomato, and watermelon. Other crops damaged include avocado, citrus, peanut, sunflower, velvet bean, tobacco and various flowers. Grasses are rarely eaten. One of the more preferred host plants is the lima bean, probably due to contact of cyanogenic glycoside linamarin. The lima bean is known to contain up to 31 ppm cyanide in some varieties.


=== Glucosinolates ===
Glucosinolates are feeding deterrents and are toxic to non-adapted herbivores. With higher glucosinolate concentrations, there is reduced feeding by S. eridania on B. juncea, a host plant. There is relative unresponsiveness of S. eridania to variation in myrosinase activity. This suggests that glucosinolates may have originated as defenses against generalist herbivores. Insects selectively adapting to glucosinolates may have selected for stronger defense produced by their rapid hydrolysis by myrosinase.


== Environmental impact ==
Larvae are defoliators and feed gregariously while young, often skeletonizing leaves. As they mature they become solitary, and also bore readily into fruit, often damaging tomatoes in Florida. It can result in significant yield losses if uncontrolled. When stressed by a lack of food they will eat the apical portions of branches, bore into stem tissue, and attack tubers near the surface of the soil.


== Insecticides ==


=== Neem-based insecticide ===
A lot of research has been done on neem-based insecticides. There has been growing interest in the agricultural sector in using plant and botanical insecticides as alternatives to restore a biologically base equilibrium in insect populations. Neem has been shown to be a feeding deterrent for insects. The primary active ingredient in neem is azadirachtin, a steroid-like tetranortriterpenoid, that exhibits a wide range of bioactivity to hundreds of phytophagous insect species from different orders.  There has been shown evidence that neem based products interfere with the regulation of feeding and metabolism as well as with anatomy and function of midgut tissues. Neem-based formulations of pesticides reduced the amount of food ingest by S. eridania larvae. The growth that is disrupted by neem is determined not only by feeding inhibition but also by digestibility, as the S. eridania larvae showed reduced efficiency in converting ingested food. These setbacks in growth and food ingestion and digestion extend the development time of larvae. Neem-based pesticides are exceptional in having broad range of bioactivity against herbivores that include toxicity, growth regulation, repellency, feeding deterrency, and disruption of metamorphosis.
Pure neem oil has been found to be the most effective antifeedants by the third instar. Pure neem oil and azatrol are most effective feeding deterrent for the second and fourth instars of southern armyworm. Although these products worked in laboratory experiences, it was found that the magnitude of the negative effect on the larval mortality and pupal ecdysis varied considerably among neem-derived insecticides tested.


=== GMO soybean plants ===
Research has also been done with the genetically modified soybean plant. They are created with insect resistance genes from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt-plants) and increasingly being cultivated around the world. Research has shown that the Bt soybean does not affect pest foliage consumption but does reduce larval duration by around two days.


=== Field corn ===
Larvae fed on fresh ear of field corn that expressed the Bt proteins (Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2), showed a 100% mortality rate. Bt is found all over the world and they produce a protein crystal that is toxic to insects. It is also safer than synthetic pesticides, and is also selective towards specific insects. S. eridania larvae survived less than two days after consuming Bt corncobs, while larvae reared on non-Bt corn cobs showed higher larval development than other species in Lepidoptera family. They ended up having poor development when fed on maize leaves.


=== Soybean cultivars ===
In the cerrado region of Brazil, the S. eridania has high capacity of defoliation and high population densities. It is an important pest of soybean, causing damage and economic losses. The cultivar of monsoy 8757 had the most significant impact on the development of S. eridania. There is an increase in duration of larval, pupal and total cycle, and a reduction in pupal mass. The consequences may be favorable to the producer since the extension of the duration of the life cycle can reduce the number of generations that cycle in the field, and decrease the number of pests in the field.


=== Plant phenols ===
Two classes of phenols were analyzed for their effect on the southern armyworm. Rutin and quercetin were found to cause some mortality. The larvae died about 2–4 days after the onset of trials. Rutin also reduced growth rates by decreasing the consumption and digestion efficiency of the larvae. Salicortin, a gut toxin, caused numerous lesions in the gut of larvae, and were large and abundant in every section. However, these results do show that toxicity is not an inherent trait of even a narrowly defined class of phytochemicals, as minor structural changes within the compound masked reactive sites, which changes solubility and susceptibility of the chemical.


== Life history ==


=== Life cycle ===
The number of generations is estimated at four each year in Florida. In northern Florida, moths can be found throughout the year, withstanding several days of freezing weather. S. eridania larvae are found in northern Florida only in the summer months, which is consistent with most other insects. One generation is about 30 to 40 days.


==== Egg ====
The shape of the eggs is a flattened sphere. Eggs measure about 0.45 mm in diameter and 0.35 mm in height. The eggs are green initially, turning tan as they age. Eggs are laid in clusters, and covered with scales from the body of the moth. Duration of the egg stage is four to six days.


==== Larvae ====
The armyworm has six instars as they grow to attain a length of about 35 mm. Larvae are green or blackish green with uniform light brown or reddish brown through the period of development. Each side has a broad yellowish stripe that has a dark spot on the first abdominal segment. Series of dark triangles are usually present dorso-laterally along the length of the body. Larvae are usually found on the lower part of leaves and are more active at night than during the day. The larval stage usually lasts around 14 to 20 days.


==== Pupae ====
Larvae pupate in the ground soil, at a depth of 5 to 10 cm; pupae are mahogany brown and are about 16–18 mm in length and 5-6mm in width; duration of the pupal period is about 11–13 days. Female pupae may have difficulty in transforming into adults. There is also sexual dimorphism between the female and male pupae. The larger size of the female may be attributed to the additional instar. Survival of males from large pupae tends to be shorter than males from small pupae. Larger males and females that emerged from larger pupae tend to survive for shorter periods of time. Fecundity has also been found to be positively correlated with size.


==== Adults ====
The adult moth measures about 33 to 38 mm in wing span. The forewings are colored gray and brown. Its wing pattern is highly variable with some with bean-shaped spot near the center of the wing whereas others do not have the spot. The back or hind wings are opalescent white.

=== Management ===
The southern armyworm is best controlled with foliar insecticides when larvae are small. Insecticides vary considerably in their toxicity to larvae, which are difficult to control with botanical insecticides. Berger (1920) reported some success at southern armyworm suppression by application of bran bait containing insecticide. However, this is primarily useful for large, mobile larvae that have left the plant and are on the soil surface.

Mythimna unipuncta,species,wikipedia.org,"Mythimna unipuncta, the true armyworm moth, white-speck moth, common armyworm, or rice armyworm, is a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1809. Mythimna unipuncta occurs in most of North America south of the Arctic, as well as parts of South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Although thought to be Neotropical in origin, it has been introduced elsewhere, and is often regarded as an agricultural pest. They are known as armyworms because the caterpillars move in lines as a massive group, like an army, from field to field, damaging crops.
The true armyworm has a distinct migration pattern in which they travel north in the spring and south in the fall to ensure that mating occurs in a favorable environment in the summer. While progressing through the life cycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult, this species must avoid attack from predatory bugs, birds, wasp and fly parasitoids, and bacterial and fungal diseases. As polygamous insects, females release sex pheromones and choose multiple males as mates. The production and release of the pheromones are influenced by temperature, photoperiod, and the juvenile hormone. Hearing is an important sense for the true armyworm, necessary for mating and evading bat predation.


== Geographic range ==
M. unipuncta are commonly found around the world including the Americas, southern Europe, central Africa, and western Asia. In North America, they inhabit areas east of the Rocky Mountains and in northern Canada.


== Food resources ==


=== Larvae ===
Larvae feed and damage on a variety of Graminae (weedy grasses) and other crops.


=== Adults ===
Adults feed on the nectar of various types of flowers and will eat ripe or decaying fruit.


== Life history ==


=== Life cycle ===
In a given year, there can be two to three generations, each generation requiring 30–50 days to complete.


=== Egg ===
Adults oviposit in groups of 2 to 5 rows on dry leaves and grass, especially between the leaf sheath and blade. Females may deposit up to 80 eggs per cluster, leading to highly dense larvae populations. Total reproductive capacity for females is between 500-1500 eggs. The egg stage lasts on average 3.5 days in warmer weather and 6.5 days in cooler weather.
The eggs appear to be a white or yellowish color but change to a gray hue right before eclosion. A sticky material on the surface of the egg sticks to surrounding foliage and helps hide the eggs.


=== Larvae ===
The true armyworm larval stage lasts at least six instars but may extend to nine. The caterpillar grows from 4 to 35 mm within this stage. The larval stage lasts about 20 days in warmer weather and 30 days in cooler weather. When the larvae hatch, they feed on the foliage on which they were laid, but if disrupted, larvae release silk and fall into the soil. Larvae in the later instars are nocturnal and will often hide under the soil for protection during daylight.
The larvae are usually grayish green or grayish brown but have characteristic longitudinal stripes along the length of the body. Seitz describes it ""The larva is green to brown, freckled with darker; the lines obscure; dorsal line almost lost in a dark clouding; subdorsal lines plainer, with the upper edge diffuse: lateral and spiracular lines white.""  See also Hacker et al.


=== Pupa ===
Pupation occurs underground in a silken case produced by the larvae. The pupa is usually 13–17 mm long and 5–6 mm wide. A pair of hooks protrude from the abdomen. The pupal stage lasts 7–14 days in warmer conditions and up to 40 days in cooler conditions.
The color of the pupae is initially yellowish brown but changes to a mahogany-brown hue.


=== Adult ===
The adult true armyworms are nocturnal insects. A complete generation from egg to adult lasts 30–50 days. Life expectancy in warm conditions is 9 days in males and 10 days in females. In cooler conditions, life expectancy is 19 days in males and 17 days in females.
Adults have a wingspan of approximately 4 cm. Black dots line the anterior edge of the forewings, making them look very pointed. There is a centrally located darker area that has several white dots as well. The hindwings have a more grayish tint. In Seitz it is described thus- The forewings are ochreous grey, freckled with darker grey, often suffused with rufous and with obscure markings. The orbicular and reniform stigmata are pale or yellowish, the latter with a white dot at lower end. There is an outer row of dark dots on veins, joined by a dark streak from apex. The hindwings are fuscous grey, paler basewards, the veins dark.


== Migration ==
P. unipuncta are seasonal migratory moths that travel north in the spring to escape high temperatures and south in the winter to escape cold temperatures. It has been shown that females reared in high temperatures mated less often, and those that did copulate experienced a 10-fold decrease in fertile egg production compared to females reared in temperate conditions. This could indicate an evolutionarily beneficial reason for this migratory behavior. Females flying in the spring northern migration were found to have developed ovaries and mating experience whereas females flying in the fall southern migration were found to have little or no reproductive organ development. This lends further support to mating being favored in the summer months.


== Enemies ==


=== Predators ===
Many species feed on armyworm larvae. These include ground beetles, who share the same habitat in the soil, in addition to predatory bugs, ants, and spiders. The bobolink, a small type of blackbird, has been nicknamed the ""armyworm bird"" in North America because of its predation on armyworms. Other birds that pose a predation risk are crows and starlings.


=== Parasitoids ===
There are over 60 wasp and fly parasitoid species that terrorize the true armyworm. The larvae of the parasitoids live in the true armyworm and ultimately kill the host. Some examples of wasp parasitoids include Meteorus autographae and Cotesia marginiventris.


=== Diseases ===
Bacterial and fungal diseases can harm the true armyworm especially in densely populated areas. In particular, the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has been recorded. Viral infections including several granulosis, cytoplasmic polyhedrosis, and nuclear polyhedrosis can wipe out entire populations, especially when coupled with poor food and weather conditions.


== Mating ==


=== Female calling behavior ===
When females are ready to mate, they release sex pheromones through a behavior known as calling. On average, this behavior is displayed around 4–6 days after emergence; age of calling onset is determined by ambient temperature and photoperiod. Low temperatures and short photoperiods delay the calling period, but higher temperatures and long photoperiods trigger calling period sooner after emergence These are consistent with the yearly changes in the behavior of P. unipuncta: the moth is in migration in the fall and spring seasons, and P. unipuncta prefer to mate in the summer. Females can mate about 5 or 6 times in their lifetime.


=== Juvenile hormone ===
The juvenile hormone, released by the corpora allota, is necessary for females to produce and release pheromones through their calling behavior. The corpora allata is an endocrine gland that when removed, causes pheromone synthesis and calling behavior to cease. The juvenile hormone also plays a role in ovarian development. When the corpora allata is removed in females, the ovaries are underdeveloped, whereas in insects with intact corpora allata, mature gametes are formed. The ovaries are not necessary for pheromone production or release, though, because removing the ovaries did not impact pheromone levels in the insect. Neuroendocrine control of calling behavior allows P. unipuncta to determine when mating is favorable or not.


=== Female mate choice ===
Males have specific scent organs called hair-pencils that contain benzyl alcohol in young males as well as benzaldehyde and acetic acid. Female antennae can detect benzaldehyde and acetic acid. It has been shown that females are more likely to choose males with intact hair-pencils than males with hair-pencils removed. However, these scent organs are not necessary for copulation as a significant portion of females will still mate with males with no hairpencils. The amount of sex pheromone released by males decreases as the number of matings increase. It has been shown that females reject males with lower pheromone levels.
Females reject males in multiple ways. First, the female may walk or fly away. If the male has already clasped the female, the female will arch her abdomen and walk or fly away in the opposite direction until the male releases his grip.


=== Female abdominal marks ===
Non-virgin females are often marked on the abdomen after mating by the male. However, many non-mated females have markings. This may be from males clasping the females, leaving a mark, but unsuccessfully copulating.


=== Male mating habits ===
Males wait on average three days after eclosion to begin mating. The delay can be attributed to the time it takes to transfer sperm to the duplex, an accessory gland. After every mating, the male must wait 6 hours for the duplex to be refilled in order to mate again. Males have at least two partners in their lifetime. Males who have a higher reproductive rate and mate more frequently suffer from a shorter lifespan than virgin males or males that mate less frequently. There is a limit to the number of mates a male can have, though, because after approximately the seventh mating, eggs in females are not properly developed due to deficient and limited ejaculate.
In the fall, males do not respond to female sex pheromones, indicating that males also delay mating before winter and during migration.


=== Preventing cross-species mating ===
M. unipuncta males can distinguish females of their own species from those of other species by recognizing the contents of the female sex pheromone. One study looked at how M. unipuncta males responded to lures containing their own pheromone and to lures containing the sex pheromone of a sympatric species known as Sesamia nonagrioides. When (Z)-11-hexadecenal, a component found in the sex pheromones of S. nonagrioides females, was added to the lures, the M. unipuncta males were less attracted. Therefore, the males' ability to detect certain acetates in the pheromones serves as a reproductive isolating mechanism and prevents cross-species mating.


== Physiology ==


=== Hearing ===
It has been suggested that hearing is important for mating. Females will often increase their wing fanning frequency when males are approaching. In response to female sex pheromones, males may produce a low-frequency trembling noise.
When echolocation sounds of bats were simulated around P. unipuncta, females stopped calling behavior and males stopped flapping their wings. This species uses their tympanal organ to stop mating behavior in the presence of predators.


== Interactions with humans ==


=== Pest of crop plants ===
The true armyworm is considered an agricultural pest. During the caterpillar stage, the larvae feed on leaves. This species prefers grass weeds, (such as Urochloa ramosa,) but when those are depleted, they quickly move to crops. Outbreaks of true armyworm swarms are not uncommon.
In the United States, the western regions of New York experienced an outbreak of common armyworms around May 2012. While the infestation remained fairly localized, it obliterated several hay and corn fields.
When fields are prone to being attacked, the crops should be checked periodically, especially in the first two weeks of June. Pheromone traps can be used to gauge size of adult populations. The damage on leaves is a telling sign that insecticides and baits may be useful in combating an outbreak.

Trichoplusia ni,species,wikipedia.org,"The cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) is a medium-sized moth in the family Noctuidae, a family commonly referred to as owlet moths. Its common name comes from its preferred host plants and distinctive crawling behavior. Cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, bok choy, and broccoli, are its main host plant; hence, the reference to cabbage in its common name. The larva is called a looper because it arches its back into a loop when it crawls.
While crucifers are preferred, over 160 plants can serve as hosts for the cabbage looper larvae. The adult cabbage looper is a migratory moth that can be found across North America and Eurasia, as far south as Florida and as far north as British Columbia. Its migratory behavior and wide range of host plants contribute to its broad distribution.
The cabbage looper larva is a minor vegetable pest, especially for crucifers. While it is not significantly destructive, it is becoming difficult to manage due to its broad distribution and resistance to many insecticides. Numerous methods are being researched in order to control this species.


== Taxonomy ==
The cabbage looper larva is a type of cabbage worm, a general term for a Lepidopteran pest that primarily feeds on crucifers. They closely resemble each other, in that they are all smooth and green, but they are not closely related in terms of phylogeny. In fact, none of the cabbage worms bear close phylogenetic relations, as they are all from different families. The cabbage looper is a member of the family Noctuidae, one of the largest families in Lepidoptera. It is related to other vegetable pests, like the cutworm and armyworms.


== Reproduction and life cycle ==


=== Mating ===
When ready to mate, cabbage loopers display by elevating their abdomen and fanning their wings. Males also fan out their abdominal hairs, open their genital claspers, and partially stick out their spermatophores. Males gradually expose more of their spermatophores as they wait for a mate. Upon interest, a potential mate examines the other's abdomen with antennae, and mating occurs if both agree. Mating on average occurs at 2am, but has been observed occurring between 12 and 4am. Mating generally occurs 3–4 days after emergence, but can occur up to 16 days afterwards. Usually, mating does not occur before the third day, as eggs are not fully developed upon emergence and require a few days to reach maturity.
Multiple matings is a mating strategy where individuals have multiple mates in their lifetime. This is in contrast to monogamy, where individuals have one mate for life. Mating multiply can be advantageous to both sexes, which is why this strategy has evolved in many species, including the cabbage looper. For female cabbage loopers, rate of oviposition increases with the number of matings, and ultimately lay more eggs total. While it was once believed that multiple matings were necessary to fertilize all eggs, evidence shows that only one mating is needed to fertilize almost all eggs. Instead, it is more likely that the spermatophore provides nutrients to the female that confers reproductive benefits. This may explain why males produce female-attracting pheromones, as females may be seeking nutrient-rich spermatophores. For male cabbage loopers, multiple matings did not affect the quality of their spermatophores, suggesting that they can maximize reproductive opportunities without decreasing fecundity.


=== Sexual role reversal ===
Conventional mate-finding strategy involves males seeking and competing for females and females caring for offspring. In many animals, however, the opposite occurs, where the females competes for males and males care for young. This role reversal can occur for a variety of reasons: environmental conditions, timing of fertilization, and biased sex ratios. For example, male fish often provide more parental care because, after females lay their eggs, males have to ensure that their sperm fertilizes the eggs and does not get washed away. It may be beneficial for the female to lay more eggs instead of caring for the eggs, so she departs as the male fertilizes the eggs, leaving him to care for the eggs. The cabbage looper generally utilizes typical mating strategies, in that males compete for females. However, occasionally the reverse occurs, where females will seek males. This only happens under particular selection conditions, such as a shortage of males or host plants that bias the sex ratio towards females.


=== Oviposition ===
After mating, the female seeks a host plant and lays her eggs, also known as oviposition. Oviposition actually can occur without mating, even as early as just after emergence from the pupa. However, oviposition right after emergence is futile, because the eggs do not mature in the female until the third day of adulthood, and therefore are not fertile until then. Host plant of choice for oviposition will depend on larval experience, known as learned host behavior. Moths unfamiliar with a host plant will avoid ovipositing on that plant and instead preferentially oviposit on a familiar host, even if the familiar host produces unappetizing chemicals. This demonstrates that larvae and moths develop host preferences and that the species is slow to determine whether a plant chemical is toxic, given that the larva is not immediately turned off by the unappetizing chemicals. This choice is also influenced by insect waste, also known as larval frass, as its presence serves as a chemical deterrent for potential mothers. Larval frass indicates that the site is already occupied, therefore avoiding overcrowding.


=== Life cycle ===


==== Egg ====
The cabbage looper eggs are generally yellow-white in color, dome-shaped, and patterned with ridges. They are 0.6mm in diameter and 0.4mm in height, and they are usually laid singly on the underside of leaves. In one day, 40–50 females can lay 1000–2000 viable eggs. Viable eggs hatch after about three days, while unviable eggs fail to develop and collapse within that period. Eggs are mostly found on leaves that are both larger and higher on the plant. It is not clear why eggs are preferentially laid on these leaves.


==== Larva ====
Cabbage looper larvae are a type of cabbage worm, green in colour with a white stripe on the side. After hatching, they are green and slightly hairy, but eventually turn green and lose the hair, leaving only a few bristles. They are identified by their looping behaviour, in which they arch their body in a loop when they crawl. Larvae are generally 3–4  cm long, and can have four to seven instars within 9–14 days. Larvae initially do not consume much food but increase their consumption during their lifetime until they are consuming three times their weight daily.


==== Pupa ====

When they pupate, they attach to the undersides of leaves and form a silky cocoon. This stage can last 4–13 days, depending on the temperature of the environment. Male pupae are slightly larger than female.


==== Adult ====
The adult form is a moth with gray-brown front wings and light brown back wings. It is about 2.5 cm long and has a wingspan of 3.8 cm. Because they are nocturnal, adults spend their days protected by their host plants and begin activity 30 minutes before sunset. Males can be distinguished from females by light brown hairs that lie flat against their abdomen. Mating occurs 3 or 4 days after metamorphosis, during which 300–1400 eggs are oviposited. From egg to adulthood, the cabbage looper's life cycle is generally 24–33 days long.


== Distribution and migration ==
The cabbage looper can be found across North America and Eurasia, as far south as Florida and as far north as British Columbia.
Cabbage looper populations in North America migrate from Mexico to Canada, depending on the seasons. It generally overwinters in Mexico or southern California, where temperatures are above 16 °C (61 °F) even during winter. It used to be frequently found in Florida, but this has lessened due to fewer cabbage crops. As northern regions of North America grow warmer, the cabbage looper gradually moves upward, only migrating if the region is above 16 °C (61 °F). During summer, it is less commonly found in southern regions, due to high temperatures. Similar to the monarch butterfly, populations presumably migrate in groups, as there is little genetic difference between source and migrating populations.
Similar seasonal distributions were found in Europe. There, the cabbage looper can be found from England to southeastern Europe.


== Temperature ==
The cabbage looper migration patterns are highly temperature dependent, as temperature can impact development. It has the greatest impact on pupation, where pupae often cease to finish metamorphosis if grown at 10 °C (50 °F). Even if pupae are transferred from 10 °C to 12.7 °C (54.86 °F), they often emerge deformed, sometimes developing an extra instar. Temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F) also result in physical deformations in adults, such as poor wing development. Mating and flight are negatively impacted by temperatures above 32 °C (89.6 °F) and below 16 °C, which may explain why cabbage loopers migrate to northern regions once temperatures reach 16 °C. The time between female calling and male response increases as temperature increases, but when the temperature reaches 27 °C (80.6 °F), mating increases. At the same time, oviposition and longevity decrease, with hatching almost ceasing at 32 °C. The embryo itself is actually quite resilient, as it is able to develop at 10 °C and at 40 °C (104 °F). However, although it is developed, it is unable to hatch. Temperature does not affect the pheromone-sensitive receptor neurons.


== Host plants ==
The cabbage looper is a generalist insect that can reside and feed on over 160 host plants. The looper's variety of hosts is partially due to the ability of its salivary glands to differentially express based on the host. For example, cabbage and tomato plants use defensive strategies involving different compounds, and the cabbage looper can combat either by upregulating the appropriate genes. The gland's high responsiveness to the diet allows for considerable flexibility in host plants. The cabbage looper's preferred hosts are crucifers such as cabbage and broccoli, because it grows faster on these plants, possibly due to nutritional or chemical differences. Tobacco can also be a host for the cabbage looper. However, it is not preferred because gummosis, a gummy substance produced by some plants, and trichomes, hair-like appendages, harm early larvae survival. Older larvae are more resistant to these defenses.
The number of caterpillars on a plant can depend on a plant's maturity. Cabbages that mature early are less attractive, whereas cabbages just beginning to head are the most attractive. Among crucifers, there generally seems to be no preference for one specific type of crucifer, like kale over cabbage or broccoli over brussels sprouts. The only apparent preference is for red cabbage – nearby double the number of caterpillars were present on the red cabbage compared to the green. This suggests that the number of caterpillars on a host plant has less to do with the species of host than with the host's height and foliage.


=== Attraction to odors ===
Cabbage loopers detect plant odors to locate food resources and suitable host plants for laying eggs, thereby increasing their chances for survival and reproduction. Mated females respond faster to plant odors compared to their unmated female and male counterparts. This difference in response time may be a result of mated females needing host plants for both food and egg laying whereas unmated individuals mostly use host plants for food, so mated females have greater motivations to find a host plant. The cabbage looper is attracted to the floral compounds:

phenylacetaldehyde
methyl salicylate
2-phenylethanol
benzaldehyde
benzyl alcohol
benzyl acetate
methyl-2-methoxy benzoate
Although the strongest attractor is phenylacetaldehyde, the cabbage looper is more attracted to a blend of odors than phenylacetaldehyde alone.


== Pheromones ==


=== Biosynthesis ===
Similar to other pheromone biosynthesis reactions, female cabbage looper pheromone production initiates with synthesis of 16 and 18-carbon fatty acids. This is followed by desaturation at C1 and chain shortening by two or four carbons. Finally, the fatty acid is reduced and acetylated to form an acetate ester. The result is a blend of different female pheromone compounds at a consistent ratio. This ratio can be highly altered by mutations in chain shortening proteins, demonstrating that the chain shortening step is important for determining the ratio of pheromones in the final blend.
As a species, the cabbage looper does not hormonally regulate pheromone production. Stage specific proteins correspond to the development of the pheromone gland. The immature gland lacks numerous enzymes crucial to pheromone biosynthesis, such as fatty acid synthetase and acetyltransferase, which is why the looper cannot produce pheromones prior to the adult stage. Upon complete development of the pheromone glands at the adult stage, pheromones are constantly produced.


=== Male pheromones ===
d-linalool
m-cresol
p-cresol
Although males engage in mate searching behavior more often than females, male cabbage loopers also produce pheromones from the hair pencils on the abdomen. Different blends of pheromones serve as competitive advantages for mating, as certain pheromone components are more appealing to females than others. Cresol is important for attractiveness to females, while linalool is found in floral odors and is believed to attract individuals searching for nutrients. Males around host plants are more attractive to females, because plant odor enhances the attractiveness of the male pheromone. This is advantageous to females because it helps with mate choice, as plant odor-enhanced males are more likely to be near a host plant. The male pheromone may also be related to food-finding behavior, as both males and females are more attracted to the male pheromone when starving. Although there is no direct evidence demonstrating that males release pheromones in response to host plant odor, it is highly possible this behavior occurs, and that the lack of evidence is due to either the choice of host plant or the experimental setup.


=== Female pheromones ===
cis-7-dodecenyl acetate
cis-5-dodecenyl acetate
11-dodecenyl acetate
cis-7-tetradecenyl acetate
cis-9-tetradecenyl acetate
dodecyl acetate
Cabbage loopers are unique in that both females and males release pheromones in order to seek a mate. Generally, females release pheromones from the tips of their abdomens, and males seek females upon detection. Females around host plants are more attractive to males, possibly because females release more pheromones in the presence of host plant odor. Although it is not clear why host plant odors incite female pheromone production, this response may help reduce time wasted spent searching for a mate and therefore increase the chance of mating. Female cabbage loopers usually attract the male, as females have more to lose by spending energy and time on searching for a mate.


==== Detection ====
Cabbage loopers possess olfactory receptor neurons on their antennae for detecting pheromones. The neurons are specifically located on two sensory structures called sensilla that differ in length and pore density. Male loopers have two types of neurons, and depending on which sensilla that are present, the neurons will detect female pheromones at varying sensitivities to each of the six pheromones. The neurons are most sensitive to the main component of the female pheromone blend, cis-7-dodecenyl acetate, and the male inhibitory signal, cis-7-dodecenol. The presence of cis-7-dodecenyl acetate is crucial for male response to female pheromones, as it is 80% of the entire blend. The base region of the antennae, where receptor neurons for this pheromone are located, has more sensory structures than the ends. The base region is also less likely to experience damage, showing the importance of detecting the pheromone. It is not clear why male neurons detect the inhibitory compound, as there is no evidence showing that females produce this compound. One possibility is that its presence in the female pheromone blend may be too small to be detected by scientific equipment. The inhibitory signal only elicits a response when delivered alongside female pheromones to avoid mixing signals from other species, suggesting that while it cannot be detected in the female pheromone blend, it has an important role in female detection.
These neurons are also capable of recognizing and responding to cis-7-tetradecenyl acetate and cis-9-tetradecenyl acetate. There are no specialized neurons for the other three pheromones. Instead, these minor pheromones can cross-stimulate neurons, which is why partial blends that lack one or two of the minor pheromones can still fully stimulate the male receptors.


== Enemies ==


=== Predators ===
General predators like spiders, ants, and lady beetles prey on cabbage looper eggs and larvae, removing 50% of the eggs and 25% of the larvae within three days. Lady beetles consume at the highest rate. Other common predators of cabbage looper larva include Orius tristicolor, Nabis americoferus, and Geocoris pallens.


=== Parasites ===
While the cabbage looper frequently encounters parasites, its most common parasite is the tachinid fly. In one study, 90% of the parasitized larvae were due to the tachinid fly. It parasitizes most often in the late fall and winter, but it is capable of parasitizing year-round. Cabbage loopers at their third or fourth instar yield the most parasites. It is early enough in the larval stage that the maggots still have time to feed and grow before pupation can prevent parasite emergence. It is also late enough that the caterpillars are large enough to support the maggots. Fly oviposition is often triggered by the larva thrashing to repel the fly, regardless of whether the larvae are already parasitized. As a result, larvae are often overparasitized, overwhelming and killing smaller larvae. During oviposition, the mother glues the fly egg to the host. This helps the maggot burrow into the larva, where it remains until the third day. The maggot cuts a slit into the back and eats its way out of the larva.


=== Diseases ===
The moth is susceptible to viral diseases including nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). This is a naturally occurring virus whose natural hosts include Lepidoptera, arthropods, and Hymenoptera. From the family Baculoviridae, it is a type of Alphabaculovirus and its genome is 80–180kb long. NPVs are commonly used as pesticides for the cabbage looper. There are numerous NPVs, many of which were isolated from the cabbage looper or the alfalfa looper. NPVs vary in infectivity and virulence. For example, the AcMNPV isolates are more infectious than the TnSNPV (the SNPV/single nuclear polyhedrosis virus specific to the cabbage looper) isolates in the first instar, while the TnSNPV isolates produced more occlusion bodies, protein structures that protect the virus and increase long term infectivity. TnSNPVs are their most lethal during the third and fourth instars; they have detrimental effects such as delayed development, reduced egg production, and fewer hatched eggs. These effects are significantly diminished when the larvae are infected during the fifth instar, suggesting that the earlier infection is more effective.
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a gram-positive soil bacterium from the phylum Bacillota. It is often used as a biological insecticide for numerous insect pests, including the cabbage looper, and reduces both growth rate and pupal weight. The cabbage looper has demonstrated resistance to Bt, specifically the toxin Cry1Ac, due to an autosomal recessive allele. Although it is not entirely clear which gene causes the resistance phenotype, there is strong evidence supporting the correlation between a mutation in the membrane transporter ABCC2 and Bt resistance. Other studies with greenhouse-evolved population of Bt resistant cabbage looper demonstrate that the downregulation of the aminopeptidase N, APN1, results in its resistance.


== Genome ==
The cabbage looper genome is 368.2 Mb long (scaffold N50=14.2 Mb; contig N50=621.9 kb; GC content=35.6%) and includes 14,037 protein-coding genes and 270 microRNA (miRNA) genes. The genome and annotation are available at the Cabbage Looper Database. The cabbage looper genome is larger than the Drosophila melanogaster genome (180Mb) but smaller than the Bombyx mori genome (530mb). It encodes at least 108 cytochrome P450 enzymes, 34 glutathione S-transferases, 87 carboxylesterases, and 54 ATP-binding cassette transporters, some of which may be involved in its insecticide resistance. It has the ZW sex-determination system, where females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ). Its telomeres contain (TTAGG)n repeats and transposons belonging to the non-long-terminal-repeat LINE/R1 family, similar to the silkworm.
The PiggyBac Transposon, a widely used tool for genetic engineering, was originally discovered in the cabbage looper and subsequently identified in other taxa as well.


== Interactions with humans ==


=== Crop damage ===
Similar to the diamondback moth, the cabbage looper is one of the most problematic cabbage pests. The larvae eat large holes in the underside of leaves and consume developing cabbage heads. In addition, they leave behind sticky frass, contaminating the plants. They also consume the leaves of myriad host plants beyond cabbages. Although it is a damaging pest, the cabbage looper can be tolerated. For example, plant seedlings can endure the cabbage looper. However, the cabbage looper becomes more problematic once the plant begins heading. This pest's infamous reputation likely stems from its ability to easily infest a variety of crops and growing difficulty managing it, because the cabbage looper is growing resistant to biological insecticides and synthetic insecticides.


=== Management ===


==== Sex pheromone traps ====
There is extensive research in cabbage looper pheromones for the goal of developing traps to catch the moth. Initial research involved isolation of the female pheromone to identify the compounds and potentially synthetically replicate the natural female pheromone. Scientists were able to develop a synthetic version that functions biologically like the natural form. The synthetic female pheromone has been used with black light traps to study cabbage looper populations in various regions of the US. Synthetic male pheromone has also been developed and was found to be effective in attracting and trapping both male and female cabbage loopers. The blend of male pheromones helped to trap females seeking mates and individuals seeking food. Further studies in Arizona showed that pheromone baited black light traps are not effective in managing the cabbage looper. The traps did capture some males, which resulted in less mating and therefore fewer eggs laid. However, the effect was not large enough to cease using insecticides, as farming standards require crops that are basically insect-free.


==== Insecticides ====
Scientists are actively seeking methods for controlling the cabbage looper. Known as an evolutionary arms race, scientists are constantly researching ways to control the cabbage looper while the looper evolves resistance to the management methods. Synthetic insecticides are relatively effective; however, many of them are banned for their toxicity. One exception is Ambush. Studies have shown that this pyrethroid insecticide is effective at killing cabbage looper eggs, and its usage is permitted in the US. Other studies have explored the usage of biological insecticides; for example, a polyhedrosis virus was shown to be effective. Unfortunately, managing large quantities of this virus would be difficult, so it is not a feasible option.
An effective option is to use synthetic and biological insecticides together; this method seems to both control the population and slow the development of resistance, but it still requires the usage of toxic chemicals. Currently, spraying Bacillus thuringiensis is considered to be the best option, possibly with NPV for an added benefit, but cabbage looper is growing increasingly more resistant to B. thuringiensis. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that cabbage loopers resistant to B. thuringiensis are twice as susceptible to NPVs, which provides insight into novel biological control methods.


=== Use in research ===
Baculovirus-insect cell expression is a technique used to produce large quantities of a desired protein. It takes advantage of the ability of Baculovirus to insert genes into its target cell and induce protein expression this gene. Numerous insect cells have been developed into cell lines, such as fruit flies, mosquitoes, and silkworms. The tissue of the cabbage looper has also been used to develop a cell line. It is particularly useful for its fast growth rate and less reliance upon insect haemolymph in the medium. The cabbage looper cell line has also been engineered to grow in serum-free media. Although serum helps insect cell growth, it is very expensive and can hinder subsequent experimental procedures. As a result, the development of the cell line to grow independently of serum means that the cell line could be used to produce viruses and proteins in a more affordable, efficient, and productive manner.

Condica concisa,species,wikipedia.org,"Condica concisa is a moth of the genus Condica first described by Francis Walker in 1856. The males and females can be hard to tell apart, as they are mostly the same colour (brown), but a distinguishing feature which helps to identify the moth's gender is that the hindwing of the male is white, whereas the female hindwing is light brown. The moths are quite abundant, as they can be found from the northern part of Argentina to Florida and Texas.

It is found from the southern United States (South Carolina to Florida, west to Texas), south through Guatemala, Panama, the Antilles, Paraguay, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil to Argentina.

The length of the forewings is 10–12 mm. In Louisiana, most adults are on wing from late August to November. Adults are on wing all year round in the tropics and perhaps in Florida.
The larvae feed on Sida species and possibly other plants in the Malvaceae.

Amyna stricta,species,wikipedia.org,"Amyna stricta, the eight-spot moth, is a species of owlet moth in the family Noctuidae. It is found in North, Central, and South America.
The New World population of Amyna axis was determined to be a separate species in 2015, and is now classified as this species, Amyna stricta.


== Distribution ==
The moth is common in southern North America, from Florida to Arizona. It is a regular migrant to the mid-eastern states, and rarely as far as Wisconsin, Ontario and Quebec. It migrates north each year in late summer and fall.
The MONA or Hodges number for Amyna stricta is 9070.


=== Food plants ===
The larvae feed on Amaranthus, Croton, Celosia, Digera, Helianthus, Chenopodium, Spinacia, Ipomoea, Ricinus, Arachis, Crotalaria, Medicago, Phaseolus, Hibiscus, Cardiospermum, Solanum, Corchorus and Parasponia species.
It is an irregular minor pest of mung beans (Vigna radiata), black-eyed peas (Vigna unguiclata), lucerne (Medicago sativa) and soy beans (Glycine max). Their prevalence may be under reported due to the resemblance of the caterpillar with those of Chrysoieixis species.


=== Early stages ===
The larvae are thin bodied and have faint white stripes and two pairs of ventral prolegs. At low densities of groups, caterpillars are pale green. Among caterpillars at high densities, there are higher frequencies of melanistic phenotypes. The degree of blackening varied widely, ranging from individuals with simple subdorsal-lateral patches to those that were mostly black.
Larvae perch on the undersides of leaves and along stems and petioles. At rest, the abdominal segments are often looped upward. When alarmed the larva essentially jumps from the host and continues to wreathe and wriggle wildly. Prepupal larvae take on a pinkish cast. Pupation occurs in a silken cocoon below (usually) or at the soil surface. Sand and/or plant debris are interwoven into the cocoon wall.


=== Adult ===
The adult moth is chocolate brown above and has a wingspan of 20–25 mm (0.79–0.98 in). The forewings have faint greyish-white lines and an obscure figure-of-eight mark on it. The hindwings are lighter with fainter markings. The male can be differentiated by the presence of a small semi-transparent patch on each wing.
Adults are on wing from August to October. Forewing of male with a small vesicle in cell, with a small valve of scales over it on underside, the median nervure being slightly curved. It is smaller than Amyna punctum.

Callopistria floridensis,species,wikipedia.org,"Callopistria floridensis, the Florida fern moth or Florida fern caterpillar, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found from North America (including Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, New Brunswick, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ontario, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas), south through the Caribbean (including Cuba), Mexico and Central America (including Costa Rica) to Ecuador.

The wingspan is about 29 mm (1.1 in). Adults are on wing year round in Florida and the tropics.
The larvae feed on various ferns, including Nephrolepis exaltata and Pteris vittata. It is an occasional pest in greenhouses.  The larvae were recently discovered to have high levels of arsenic when feeding on P. vittata, and are the only known terrestrial animal to accumulate arsenic.

Neotherina xanthosa,species,wikipedia.org,"Neotherina xanthosa is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by Sullivan and Chacón in 2011. It is known from above 2,400 meters in the Talamanca and the Central Volcanic ranges in Costa Rica, but its range probably extends into the other mountain ranges in Costa Rica and northern Panama.
The species is similar only to Neotherina callas, which it can be distinguished from by its yellowish-brown color and larger size. Adults are on wing year round.


== Etymology ==
The name refers to the yellowish-brown ground color of the maculation (spots).

The forewing appears to be truncated at the tip. As in most Lepidoptera, females are noticeably larger than males. The wings are diaphanous and overlaid by a distinct pattern seen only in this species and in Neotherina xanthosa. It can be separated from the latter by the darker more grayish color and its smaller size, with a male forewing length of 18–22 mm. Females have a forewing length of 19–24 mm.

Phyllodonta alajuela,species,wikipedia.org,"Phyllodonta alajuela is a moth in the family Geometridae first described by J. Bolling Sullivan in 2014. It is found in Costa Rica (Alajuela and Guanacaste provinces), possibly extending into Nicaragua. It has been recorded from altitudes between 500 and 1,150 meters.
The length of the forewings is 23.5–25 mm for males and 27 mm for females. The forewings are warm brown with prominent undulating antemedial and postmedial lines. Both lines are black edged with lighter grayish scales proximally. There is black scaling distal to the reniform at the costa, forming a diffuse line parallel to the antemedial line. The reniform spot is small and black and forms a center of a gray circle. The hindwings have a prominent postmedial line and a margin with a submedial notch. Adults are probably on wing year round.
The larvae feed on Witheringia solanacea and Brugmansia × candida.


== Etymology ==
The species is named for the province where the holotype and paratypes were taken.

Phyllocnistis citrella,species,wikipedia.org,"Phyllocnistis citrella, the citrus leafminer, is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is also known as CLM in agriculture. It was described by Henry Tibbats Stainton from India in 1856. It was first found in Florida, United States, in 1993, but is now found all over the world, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Corsica, Costa Rica, Cuba, India, Israel, Madeira, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka and other parts of the United States.
The wingspan is about 5 millimetres (0.20 in).
The larvae are considered a serious agricultural pest on Citrus species, such as Aegle marmelos, Atalantia, Citrofortunella microcarpa, Citrus limon, Citrus paradisi, Citrus maxima, Fortunella margarita, Murraya paniculata and Poncirus trifoliate. Larvae have also been recorded on Garcinia mangostana, Pongamia pinnata, Alseodaphne semecarpifolia, Loranthus and Jasminum sambac. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long epidermal corridor with a well-marked central frass line. The mine is mostly lower-surface, but sometimes upper-surface, and rarely on the rind of the developing fruit. Citrus leaf miner larvae are thus protected from many topic insecticide treatments. Pupation takes place in a chamber at the end of the corridor, under an overturned part of the leaf margin.


== Citrus leafminer distribution ==
Citrus leafminer (CLM) are native to Asia and are found throughout the continent and beyond. Japan, the Philippines, New Guinea, India and Taiwan are some of the countries in which the pest is distributed. The pest is not exclusively found in these countries having spread to nearly every citrus growing area in the world. Recent spread into North and South America was reported in the early 1990s. This is especially important because major citrus growing operations are found in Brazil and the US. These two countries account for half of the world's citrus production.


== CLM management ==


=== Insecticides ===
Insecticide applications are among the most effective methods available for managing CLM. Yet because of the CLM's ability to ""mine"" leaves insecticides are not entirely effective when dealing with CLM infestations. Cultural control, such as basic citrus tree upkeep and management, are essential to keeping mature citrus trees healthy and capable at combating CLM infestations. While a number of insecticides are used to manage CLM, concerns linger over the type and amount to apply to CLM orchards and nurseries. Some concerns include: wide-spectrum insecticides targeting more than just CLM, killing more than a single insect species this can have adverse effects on beneficial insects that prey on CLM and even beneficial pollinators like bees; insecticide resistance has been reported in certain citrus growing areas; use near residential areas. Insecticides used to manage this pest include but not limited to the following:


=== Monitoring and mass trapping ===
Traps specifically designed to lure CLM are also deployed as a mechanism to both monitor and reduce CLM population, although during high infestation situations, traps alone are not recommended without additional measures. They are, however, a good indicator of CLM population levels, which can help in developing effective management plans.
Adult citrus leafminers' mating communication is mediated by sex pheromones emitted by the adult females. A new lure that is environmentally friendly, species-specific, and emits the naturally occurring citrus leafminer pheromone has been developed targeting the management of this pest. The lure attracts adult male citrus leafminers to an insect pheromone trap over a period of 4 to 8 weeks, allowing users to monitor for its presence, determine the relative population density in the field, or use it to actually control populations by mass trapping the males.


=== Mating disruption ===
The CLM sex pheromone can also be used in the field without a trap, as a mating disruption to control and manage the pest. The mating disruption strategy is an environmentally friendly tactic that causes males to fail to find mates, reducing encounters between male and female CLM, leading to less fertilized eggs. The formulation SPLAT CLM, which combines nature-identical pheromone with SPLAT, has been registered with the US EPA to control the citrus leafminer. Unlike wide spectrum insecticides, which may impact beneficial insects (such as bees) or may cause insecticide resistance build-up, these pheromone based strategies rarely cause the development of resistance and reduce the use of conventional pesticides, thus avoiding pollution.
In the case of the citrus leafminer, the female moth produces at least two volatile compounds, a diene (two double bonds: Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal) and a triene (three double bonds: (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal) in a 3:1 triene:diene ratio that are both necessary and sufficient to attract males. It was determined that a 3:1 triene:diene blend of the synthetic pheromone was optimal for attracting males to an adhesive trap in the field in Florida. This is the same 3:1 blend that was first isolated from the female pheromone glands. However, the question of what blend (the ""natural"" 3:1 blend or some other ""unnatural"" ratio) was best for mating disruption in general was addressed for this species using geometric multivariate experiment designs combined with response surface modeling. The triene component alone achieved maximum disruption of attraction of males.


=== Attracticides ===
Advances in attractant formulations includes addition of an insecticide ingredient along with pheromone ingredients in order to attract CLM and kill the pest when it contacts the point source.

Hagnagora unnia,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora unnia is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by J. Bolling Sullivan in 2011. It is found in Costa Rica.
Males are usually smaller but otherwise are indistinguishable from those of Hagnagora elianne. They may be distinguished from Hagnagora anicata by the swollen distal half of the uncus (as opposed to gently tapered) and the absence of a moderately large, upcurved spine at the end of the costa. Females may be distinguished from those of H. elianne by their shorter, less complex signum. The female of H. anicata is undescribed. Specimens from higher altitudes are larger as are most H. elianne. Specimens from lower altitudes are smaller as are most H. unnia. Although size alone cannot always be used to distinguish the species, it is often an excellent indicator, particularly where both species occur together.


== Etymology ==
The species is named for Unni E. H. Fyhn, a postdoctoral student in the laboratory of the author in the 1970s who continued to work on the genetic control of fish hemoglobins until her untimely death from cancer.

The white blotch is narrower in Hagnagora jamaicensis, and significantly smaller, and separated from the outer margin, in Hagnagora acothysta from Brazil. All three species are significantly larger than Hagnagora guatica.

Hagnagora mirandahenrichae,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora mirandahenrichae is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by Gunnar Brehm in 2015. It is only known from the sectors Santa Maria and Pitilla from Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Guanacaste Province, in north-western Costa Rica.
Adults are easily distinguished from Hagnagora croceitincta by its wing patterns. The yellow ground colour of H. mirandahenrichae is slightly more intense than in Hagnagora clustimena.


== Etymology ==
The species is named in honour of Ms. Miranda Henrich of California in recognition of her and her mother's critical support for understanding the taxonomy and biodiversity development of the Área de Conservación Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica.

Hagnagora marionae,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora marionae is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by Gunnar Brehm and J. Bolling Sullivan in 2005. It has been collected only at two high mountain areas in
Costa Rica at elevations above 2,500 metres (8,200 ft).
The species resembles the other species of the H. anicata clade, but is easily distinguished by large orange-yellow blotches on the forewings.

Hagnagora ephestris,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora ephestris is a species of moth of the family Geometridae. It is found in Colombia.
Both H. ephestris and related H. discordata show a pronounced yellow blotch on the hindwings that is absent in H. luteoradiata. Different from H. discordata, the yellow transversal band on the forewing of H. ephestris reaches the outer margin of the wing. Moreover, the band is broader than in H. discordata, whereas the yellow field of the hindwing is narrower, particularly in the proximate half of the wing.

Hagnagora elianne,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora elianne is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by J. Bolling Sullivan in 2011. It is found in Costa Rica and Honduras.
Adults are very similar to Hagnagora anicata and Hagnagora unnia. Males are slightly larger than those of H. unnia (by 2 mm on average but with overlapping ranges) but otherwise indistinguishable. They may be distinguished from H. anicata by the swollen distal half of the uncus (as opposed to gently tapered) and the absence of a moderately large, upcurved spine at the end of the costa. Females may be distinguished from females of H. unnia by their longer, more complex signa. The female of H. anicata is undescribed.


== Etymology ==
The species is named for Eli-Anne Lindstrom, a scientist whose biological studies of freshwater algae have contributed significantly to water quality monitoring in Norway.

Hagnagora clustimena,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora clustimena is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by Herbert Druce in 1893. It is found in Mexico, Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica.
Adults are on average smaller than Hagnagora croceitincta and slightly larger than Hagnagora mirandahenrichae. The white transversal blotch on the forewing stretches to the costal margin and the apical dark-brown area reaches vein CuA2, as also observed in H. mirandahenrichae. H. clustimena is slightly paler than H. mirandahenrichae.

Hagnagora anicata,species,wikipedia.org,"Hagnagora anicata is a species of moth of the family Geometridae first described by Felder and Rogenhofer in 1875. It is a species complex with a range that extends from Mexico to Bolivia and east into western Venezuela paralleling the Andes. A population occurs on Jamaica. While traditionally considered a single species, DNA barcode and genitalic analyses indicate that five or more species are probably involved in the complex.

Adults have a cream-white band, originating on the costa near the midpoint and running diagonally toward a point 1⁄3 above the tornus, rounding off and ending without touching the margin. Distal to this band is dark brown scaling to the wing apex. Proximal to the band is dark brown scaling which becomes brighter toward the wing base. At the terminus of the wing veins are small white crescents which are usually worn off in flown specimens. The hindwing is the brownish color of the forewing base and with larger marginal crescents at the vein termini. The underside is repeated with some slight variation.

Xylophanes pistacina,species,wikipedia.org,"Xylophanes pistacina is a moth of the  family Sphingidae. It is found from Nicaragua south to Brazil and west to Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina.
The wingspan is 75–87 mm. The upperside of the abdomen has no lines. The ground colour is generally greenish-buff, although some individuals are much greener. The subbasal and antemedian lines are vestigial, the two distal lines forming a band at the apex of the discal cell. The two proximal postmedian lines are more or less merged to form a band, the inner of which is often straight. The third postmedian line is very faint and the fourth is more distinct and emphasized by vein dots. Postmedian lines two to four are dentate and postmedian line five is curved from the wing apex and continuous with a greenish olive patch. The brown border is broad. The pale band is highly suffused with olive-brown.
Adults are probably on wing year-round in Costa Rica.
The larvae possibly feed on Psychotria species.

Xylophanes tyndarus,species,wikipedia.org,"Xylophanes tyndarus is a moth of the family Sphingidae first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1875. It is distributed from Mexico and Belize to Brazil and westward into Bolivia.
The wingspan is 75 to 86 mm (3.0 to 3.4 in). The upperside of the body and wings is green, often very bright. The underside of the body is whitish green. The forewing has three narrow antemedian lines. The postmedian line is well marked, straight, the basal edge is sharply delineated, the distal edge is diffuse and it is gradually lightening toward the outer margin. The remaining postmedian lines are poorly defined or absent. The oblique apical line is short. The oblique apical line on the forewing underside forms an angle with the irregularly undulate postmedian line, the marginal area bordered by these lines is as broad as in Xylophanes schausi. The green median band on the hindwing does not reach the costa. The distal margin is often green.
There are probably at least two generations per year. In Costa Rica, adults have been recorded from November to February and again from April to July. In Brazil, adults have been recorded in September and December.
The larvae feed on Faramea occidentalis and probably other Rubiaceae species. Early instars are green with yellow eyes, and feed solely on new leaves. They turn brown in the last instar and have a yellow eyespot.

Hyles lineata,species,wikipedia.org,"Hyles lineata, also known as the white-lined sphinx, is a moth of the family Sphingidae. They are sometimes known as a ""hummingbird moth"" because of their bird-like size (2-3 inch wingspan) and flight patterns.
As caterpillars, they have a wide range of color phenotypes but show consistent adult coloration. With a wide geographic range throughout Central and North America, H. lineata is known to feed on many different host plants as caterpillars and pollinate a variety of flowers as adults.
Larvae are powerful eaters and are known to form massive groupings capable of damaging crops and gardens. As adults, they use both visual and olfactory perception to locate plants from which they collect nectar.


== Description ==


=== Caterpillar ===
Larvae show wide variation in color. The larvae are black with orange spots arranged in lines down the whole body. Their head's prothoracic shield, and the anal plate, are one color, either green or orange with small black dots. A tail-like spine protruding from the back of the body is a typical for sphingid moth caterpillars, known as “hornworms”. This horn, which may sometimes be yellow and have a black tip, is not a stinger, and the caterpillars are not harmful to humans. The larvae can also sometimes be lime green and black.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Adult ===
The forewing is dark brown with a tan stripe which extends from the base to the apex. There are also white lines that cover the veins. The black hindwing has a broad pink median band. It has a wingspan of 2 to 3 inches. This moth is large and has a stout furry body. The dorsal hind region is crossed by six distinct white stripes and similar striping patterns on the wings. The hindwings are black with a thick, red-pink stripe in the middle.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Geographic range ==
Hyles lineata is one of the most abundant hawk moths in North America and has a very wide geographic range. This range extends from Central America to southern Canada through Mexico and most of the United States. Some regions of South Asia like Sindh, Pakistan are reported to have habitates to these Moths. They can also be found occasionally in the West Indies. Rarely, specimens have also been reported in Eurasia and Africa.
The abundance of Hyles lineata populations in specific locations varies significantly from year to year, and has been thought to influence selection on flower phenotypes, although studies throughout the years show mixed results.


== Habitat ==

With such a wide geographic range, H. lineata are known to live in a variety of habitats, including deserts, gardens and suburbs. They have also been seen in abundance in the mountains of Colorado, but their presence varies from year to year in many places.

The adults will feed on different flowers depending on time of day. If at night, they will choose flowers that are white or pale colored, which are easier to identify in contrast to the dark foliage surrounding the flower. If during daylight, they will choose flowers that are more brightly colored.


== Behavior ==
The foraging patterns of H. lineata varies according to altitude, temperature and other factors, all of which are highly variable over its vast geographic distribution.

Hyles lineata prefer flying at night but also sometimes fly during the day. They are most commonly seen at dusk and dawn.


=== Pollination ===
H. lineata are common pollinators and are known to collect nectar from flowers. As caterpillars they feed on a huge diversity of host plants and as adults they prefer nectar over flowers. A study from the 1970s focused on H. lineata nectar feeding patterns in Emerald Lake, Colorado, specifically on Aquilegia coerulea flowers. Of the H. lineata individuals that had visited A. coerulea flowers, two groups of moths were identified, one with patches of pollen near their eyes and ones with no detectable pollen on their bodies. Between the two groups, tongue length was significantly different, with longer-tongued individuals having no pollen and shorter-tongued individuals having pollen. These results suggest that within H. lineata, some individuals are effective pollinators while some are not pollinating at all, with shorter-tongued individuals carrying out the most effective pollination.
Other studies have investigated its role as pollinators in flower morphology. Individuals visiting Aquilegia chrysantha flowers in Pima County, AZ, had proboscis lengths very similar to the length of the nectar spur of the flower, suggesting coevolution.
Hawk moths, including H. lineata, are considered long-tongued nectar foragers, although nearly 20% of all hawk moth species have very short tongues compared to H. lineata. A 1997 study found correlations between tongue length and latitude distribution: mean tongue length declines from around 40 mm to as short as 15 mm as northern latitude increase from 0 to 50 degrees. The author speculates that tongues have lengthened in hawk moths of extratropical regions where it is more difficult and energetically costly to find larval food plants that are often inconspicuous, thus they need to take up more nectar at once to fuel their longer flights. Conversely, in more northern regions, short tongues are sufficient because finding larval food plants is an easier task and they do not need to take up as much nectar to fuel their flights.
One 2009 study showed that whiter flowers are associated with an annual presence of hawk moths, including H. lineata. Their data also showed that the annual presence of H. lineata populations selects for whiter flowers. Other hawk moth species with similar range overlap, specifically Sphinx vashti, show a correlation of annual presence with longer spurs on flowers. Thus hawk moths in general have been demonstrated to impact selection on flower morphology.


== Life history ==


=== Oviposition ===
In the spring, adult females lay eggs on various types of plants, on which the resulting larvae feed. Each individual female can produce hundreds of eggs over her life.


=== Seasonality ===
Larvae overwinter and can emerge between February and November, at which point they begin to feed on a variety of host plants. Caterpillars are known to be ardent eaters. When preparing to transition into the pupal stage, caterpillars dig shallow burrows in the ground where they then stay for 2 to 3 weeks, at which point they emerge as adults. As they get closer to pupating, they will wiggle up closer to the surface which makes it easier to emerge.
Adults typically do not survive cold northern winters, but larvae overwinter and moths begin to appear in mid-May. Depending on abundance, a second flight may occur in late August or early September. Larvae are known to gather and form giant hordes in search of host plants, and they can eat entire plants, cover entire roadways and form huge slick masses as they go.
Typically there are two generations per year, but warmer climate see more generations.


== Physiology ==


=== Flight ===
H. lineata, when feeding, tend to hover in front of flowers and control their hovering by visual cues from the flowers.


=== Vision ===

Though hawk moths can be both diurnal or nocturnal (or both), they all have three spectral receptors that are sensitive to blue light, green light and ultraviolet. Though it was originally assumed that hawk moths relied primarily on olfactory cues to locate flowers, due to their prevalence at particularly odorous plants, studies have shown that hawk moths actually have great vision and are very sensitive to light.


=== Olfaction ===
Though vision is a key component of H. lineata physiology, they do also have strong olfactory capabilities. They have been shown to be very sensitive to odors coming from flowers, and they have a strong ability to learn flower odors quickly.


== Interactions with humans ==


=== Food source ===
The caterpillars have been (and in some places still are) gathered and eaten by Native Americans (e.g.,). After collection, they would be skewered and roasted for a feast, and any leftovers were stored whole or ground up after being dried. The nutritional value of the larvae has been analyzed, and found to be significant; they contain almost as much fat as hamburger meat, but have almost one-third less saturated fat, and more energy (in calories), protein, carbohydrate, riboflavin, and niacin than hamburger meat.


=== Pest of crop plants ===
Caterpillars often form massive groups in search for food. Outbreaks have been reported in Utah that have damaged grapes, tomatoes and garden crops.

Phereoeca uterella,species,wikipedia.org,"The adult female has a wingspan of up to 13 mm. The forewings are gray with distinct dark spots and the plain hindwings are fringed with long gray hairs. The male is smaller (wingspan up to 9 mm) and more slender with less distinct markings. The reduced mouthparts suggest this species does not feed as an adult. The female lays up to 200 tiny pale blue eggs in sheltered places.
The larva constructs a protective case from silk and camouflages it with other materials such as soil, sand and insect droppings. When the larva is fully grown, this case is up to 14 mm long (twice the length of the animal) and is noticeably thickened in the middle so that it rather resembles a pumpkin seed. This shape allows the animal to turn around inside the case (the case has openings at both ends, both used by the head of the animal). Pupation occurs within the case.
The main food source for this species appears to be silk, especially spider webs, but also silk produced by other arthropods including discarded cases from the same species. Larvae also feed on dander and fallen human hair. Wool (but not cotton) is also a favoured food and the species can be a household pest.",1168

Setomorpha rutella,species,wikipedia.org,"Setomorpha is a monotypic moth genus in the family Tineidae described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1852. Its only species, Setomorpha rutella, the tropical tobacco moth, was described by the same author in the same year. It is a widely spread species that has been distributed by commerce over much of the warmer parts of Africa, Eurasia, Malaysia, Australia, many Pacific islands and North and South America.
The wingspan is 9–22 mm. Adults are brown and speckled with dark brown or black.
The larvae feed on dried goods, cereals, grain, rice, nuts, seeds and other dry vegetable matter. It is a pest of dried tobacco leaves in some regions and it has been reported as a pest of dried insect specimens. Full-grown larvae are about 17 mm long, cylindrical, dirty white and skin transparent. The head is red brown.
The larva pupates in a closely woven and smooth cocoon within a loosely spun outer framework or outer cocoon, to which particles of food and excrement adhere.

Neococytius cluentius,species,wikipedia.org,"Neococytius is a monotypic moth genus in the family Sphingidae erected by Ronald W. Hodges in 1971. Its only species, Neococytius cluentius, the Cluentius sphinx, was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1775 as Sphinx cluentius. It is found in northern South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. It is rare on Cuba. It has been recorded in North America, from Mississippi north to Michigan and Illinois.
The wingspan is 140–160 mm. There are at least three generations in the tropics, with adults on wing from December to January, May to June (or July in Jamaica) and October.
The larvae have been recorded on Annonaceae and Piperaceae species as well as Ipomoea batatas.
Otto Porsch in 1939 discussed the potential role of the species (under the synonym Cocytius cluentius) in pollinating cacti, giving the length of its tongue as 25 cm, and noting the corresponding lengths of the flowers of night-blooming cacti. A discussion of the possible pollinators of the cactus Strophocactus wittii in 1997 used the species name Cocytius ""cruentus""; however, it cited a source that uses the correct specific name cluentius.

Manduca sexta,species,wikipedia.org,"Manduca sexta is a moth of the family Sphingidae present through much of the Americas. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1763 Centuria Insectorum.
Commonly known as the Carolina sphinx moth and the tobacco hawk moth (as adults) and the tobacco hornworm and the Goliath worm (as larvae), it is closely related to and often confused with the very similar tomato hornworm (Manduca quinquemaculata); the larvae of both feed on the foliage of various plants of the family Solanaceae. The larvae of these species can be distinguished by their lateral markings: Tomato hornworms have eight V-shaped white markings with no borders; tobacco hornworms have seven white diagonal lines with a black border. Additionally, tobacco hornworms have red horns, while tomato hornworms have dark blue or black horns. A mnemonic to remember the markings is tobacco hornworms have straight white lines like cigarettes, while tomato hornworms have V-shaped markings (as in ""vine-ripened"" tomatoes). M. sexta has mechanisms for selectively sequestering and secreting the neurotoxin nicotine present in tobacco. 
M. sexta is a common model organism, especially in neurobiology, due to its easily accessible nervous system and short life cycle. Due to its immense size M. sexta is big enough for medical imaging modalities (like CT, MRI, or PET) and used as a model in imaging and gut inflammation. It is used in a variety of biomedical and biological scientific experiments. It can be easily raised on a wheat-germ-based diet. The larva is large, and thus it is relatively easy to dissect it and isolate its organs.


== Life cycle ==
M. sexta has a short life cycle, lasting about 30 to 50 days. In most areas, M. sexta has about two generations per year, but can have three or four generations per year in Florida.


=== Eggs ===
M. sexta eggs are spherical, approximately 1.5 millimeters in diameter, and translucent green. They typically hatch two to four days after they are laid. Eggs are normally found on the underside of foliage, but can also be found on the upper surface.


=== Larva ===
M. sexta larvae are bright green in color and grow up to 100 millimeters in length. The posterior abdominal segment is tipped with a dorsocaudal horn that earns them the name ""hornworm"". The final instar consists of a cylindrical body covered with fine hairlike setae. The head is equipped with a pair of ocelli and chewing mouthparts. Each of the three thoracic segments bears a pair of true legs, and there is a pair of prolegs on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and last abdominal segments in all larval instars. The prothoracic segment bears one pair of spiracles, and additional pairs occur on each of the eight abdominal segments.
The hemolymph (blood) of this species contains insecticyanin, a blue-colored biliprotein. When the larva feeds on its normal diet of plant foliage, it ingests pigmentacious carotenoids, which are primarily yellow in hue. The resulting combination is green. Under laboratory conditions—when fed a wheat-germ-based diet—larvae are turquoise in color due to the lack of carotenoids in their diet.
The caterpillar stage of the tobacco hornworm is quite similar in appearance to that of the closely related tomato hornworm. The larvae of these two species can however be readily distinguished by their lateral markings. Specifically, the M. sexta caterpillar has seven white diagonal lines with a black border at the first seven abdominal segments, and the horn is red or green with a red tip. The M. quinquemaculatacaterpillar has V-shaped white markings with no borders at all eight of its abdominal segments, and the horn is dark blue or black in color.
During the larval stage, M. sexta caterpillars feed on plants of the family Solanaceae, principally tobacco, tomatoes and members of the genus Datura. M. sexta has five larval instars, which are separated by ecdysis (molting), but may add larval instars when nutrient conditions are poor. Near the end of this stage, the caterpillar seeks a location for pupation, burrows underground, and pupates. This searching behavior is known as ""wandering"". The imminence of pupation—suggested behaviorally by the wandering—can be anatomically confirmed by spotting the heart (aorta), which is a long, pulsating vessel running along the length of the caterpillar's dorsal side. The heart becomes visible through the skin just as the caterpillar is reaching the end of the final instar.
A common biological control for hornworms is the parasitic braconid wasp Cotesia congregata, which lays its eggs in the bodies of the hornworms. The wasp larvae feed internally and emerge from the body to spin their cocoons. Parasitized hornworms are often seen covered with multiple white, cottony wasp cocoons, which are often mistaken for large eggs. A wasp species, Polistes erythrocephalus, feeds on hornworm larvae.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Pre-pupa ===
Before the larva pupates, it goes through a stage called the pre-pupa, where it shrinks considerably and prepares to pupate. Often people mistake this stage for a dead or dying caterpillar.


=== Pupa ===
The pupal stage lasts approximately 14–18 days under laboratory conditions (17 hours light, 7 hours dark, 27 °C). When reared on a short-day photoperiod (12 hours light, 12 hours dark), pupae enter a state of diapause that can last several months. During the pupal stage, structures of the adult moth form within the pupal case, which is shed during eclosion (adult emergence).


=== Adult ===
Adult M. sexta have narrow wings with a wing span of approximately 100 mm. M. sexta moths are nectarivorous and feed on flowers, demonstrating a remarkable ability to hover.
Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are identifiable by their broader antennae and the presence of claspers at the end of the abdomen. Female moths are typically ready to mate one week after eclosion, and do so only once. Males may mate many times. Mating generally occurs on a vertical surface at night, and can last several hours, with the male and female facing in opposite positions, their posterior ends touching. After mating, females deposit their fertilized eggs on foliage, usually on the underside of leaves.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Laboratory rearing ===
Like Drosophila melanogaster, M. sexta is commonly used as a model organism for experiments. They are frequently studied in the laboratory due to their large size and relative ease of rearing. They may be reared on host plants, such as tobacco and tobacco relatives, tomato plants, or wheat-germ-based artificial diet. Their rearing is straightforward, provided they receive a long daylight cycle (e.g., 14 hours) during development to prevent diapause.
Eggs are rinsed for one to five minutes in dilute household bleach for disinfection.
Eggs are placed on diet cubes or host plants. The eggs hatch and develop at different speeds depending on temperature. The larvae are moved to a fresh diet or leaves as their food spoils or is consumed. When they start to ""wander"", they are about to pupate, so are placed in a pupation chamber. Pupation chambers are holes drilled into a wood board. The Manduca larvae are sealed in the chamber using a stopper and allowed to pupate. After pupation, the pupae are placed in a breeding or colony chamber to eclose. Providing a cup of sugar water and a tobacco (or related) plant will allow mated females to oviposit fertile eggs, which can then be reared.
When fed an artificial diet, Manduca larvae do not consume the xanthophyll -which is a yellow pigment- needed to produce their green coloration; instead they appear blue. On some diets, they have very little pigment and pigment precursors, so are a very pale blue-white. As vitamin A and other carotenoids are necessary for the visual pigments (rhodopsin), an artificial-diet-reared hornworm may have poor vision due to lack of carotenoids in the diet.


=== As pet food ===
Captive-bred hornworms fed on an artificial diet are often given to insectivorous exotic animals, such as certain reptiles, fish and small mammals. They are preferred over wild-collected hornworms, which may bioaccumulate poisonous substances found in dietary plants. Hornworms, though originally bred for laboratories, are also farmed for this purpose. They are often sold already packed into pods that include everything the larvae need, including food. Care is relatively easy, and animals seem to relish their bright color and flavor.


== Animal model ==
M. sexta larvae grow up to 100 millimeters in length, reaching up to 20 grams. Due to their large size, they are used as alternative animal models for medical imaging modalities like computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography. Researchers around Anton Windfelder have established the larvae of M. sexta as an alternative animal model for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases or as an animal model for testing new contrast agents for radiology.

== Behavior ==


=== Feeding ===
Tobacco hornworms are facultative specialists; the larvae can grow and develop on any host plants. However, the larvae prefer solanaceous plants, such as tobacco and tomato plants. On these types of plants, larvae grow and develop faster. The lateral and medial sensilla styloconia (sensory receptors) on their mouthparts help them to identify solanaceous plants by recognizing indioside D, a steroidal glycoside found in those particular plants (del Campo et al., 2001). Salicin is a distasteful phagodeterrent, found only in Salix spp. while caffeine is a phagodeterrent that is actually toxic. Schoonhoven 1969 found that M. sexta habituation to salicin is mediated by desensitization of the deterrence associated peripheral neurons and Glendinning et al. 1999 the same for caffeine. However Glendinning et al. 2001 find only a small peripheral desensitization for salicin, concluding that Schoonhoven erred, and that habituation in this case is centrally mediated. Tobacco hornworms are considered pests because they feed on the upper leaves of tobacco plants and leave green or black droppings on the plants. As adults, they do not damage plants since they feed on nectar.
Tobacco hornworm larvae prefer humid environments. When dehydrated, tobacco hornworm larvae will move towards a source of water or to an area with a high relative level of humidity. They use their antennae to locate water to drink .


=== Defense ===
Nicotine is poisonous to most animals that use muscles to move because nicotine targets the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. However, the tobacco hornworm is capable of metabolizing nicotine from the tobacco plant and using nicotine as a defense against predators. It possesses a gene called cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) that converts nicotine into a metabolite. About 0.65% of nicotine metabolites are transported from the gut to the hemolymph, where they are reconverted to nicotine and released into the air from the tobacco hornworm's spiracles. The emitted nicotine is used as a way to deter spiders, a practice known as “toxic halitosis.” In one study, tobacco hornworms that fed from nicotine-deficient plants or expressed low levels of CYP6B46 were more susceptible to wolf spider predation.
Tobacco hornworm caterpillars emit short clicking sounds from their mandibles when they are being attacked. This sound production is believed to be a type of acoustic aposematism, or warning sounds that let predators know that trying to eat them will be troublesome; tobacco hornworms have been observed to thrash and bite predators after producing those clicking sounds. These clicks can be heard at a close distance with a frequency range of 5 to 50 kHz. The intensity of clicks increases with the number of attacks (Bura et al., 2012).

Automeris io,species,wikipedia.org,"Imagines (sexually mature, reproductive stage) have a wingspan of 2.5–3.5 inches (63–88 mm). This species is sexually dimorphic: males have bright yellow forewings, body, and legs, while females have reddish-brown to purple forewings, body, and legs. The males also have much bigger plumose (feathery) antennae than the females. Both males and females have one big black to bluish eyespot with some white in the center, on each hindwing. Some hybridizations have resulted in variations in these hindwing eyespots. Adults live 1–2 weeks.",536

Automeris io,species,animaldiversity.org,"Adults of this species are considered medium to large-sized moths, with a wingspan of 5 to 9 cm.Automeris ioexhibits sexual dimorphism in its coloration. Male forewings are typically bright yellow, while females have dark yellow or brown forewings. Females may also have larger, more pointed forewings. Both males and females have large eyespots on their hindwings; the eyespots are black or blue, with a gray or bluish iris surrounding a white center. The eyespot is often larger and rounder in females than in males. Adults are likely polymorphic, with a large variety of coloration across their range. Southern variations tend to have reddish-brown forewings, while other variations can be orange-brown or purple-brown. Likewise, populations in the southern region show a variation between diapausing and non-diapausing broods. Males that developed from diapausing pupae are tawny brown, while non-diapausing males are yellowish with some red. Early instars of larvae are brown, yellow, or dull orange, and are 3 to 4 mm in length when newly hatched. Later instars are bright green, with 2 distinctive lateral stripes, a red one on top and a white stripe just below. 4th and 5th instars grow to 3 to 5 cm in length. All instars have bifurcated urticating spines. Eggs are oblong with a flattened top. They are white when first laid, with a few yellow spots on the top and sides. After a few days, the top spot changes to black, and the side spots become tinted with orange as the larvae develops.(Borror and White, 1970;Hossler, et al., 2008;Manley, 1978;Manley, 1993;Peterson, 1962;Russi, et al., 1973;Tuskes, et al., 1996)",1627

It is found from the southern United States, through Central America to Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina.
The wingspan is 60 mm. Adults are on wing year round in the tropics, southern Florida and Louisiana. They are on wing from August to November in the northern part of the range.
The larvae probably feed on Caribbean grape (Vitis tiliifolia) and other Vitaceae and Dilleniaceae species, such as Vitis, Cissus rhombifolia and Ampelopsis, Tetracera volubilis, Curatella americana, Tetracera hydrophila and Doliocarpus multiflorus. Ludwigia of the family Onagraceae might also be a host plant.
Males of the Enyo ocypete exhibit a smaller wing size than females. The many reproductive flight advantages include the ability of males to fly faster and have better fitness for mating, while females possess slower flight which is used for selecting host plants and gathering resources.

Enyo lugubris,species,wikipedia.org,"Enyo lugubris, the mournful sphinx, is a moth of the  family Sphingidae. It is found from Argentina and Paraguay to Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil and the West Indies through Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama to Mexico and the United States, where it has been recorded from Arizona east to Florida and north to South Carolina. Strays have been recorded from Arkansas, north to Illinois, Michigan and New York.
The wingspan is 50–60 mm.
Adults are on wing year round in the tropics (including southern Florida and Louisiana). Further north, they are on wing from August to November.
The larvae probably feed on Vitus tiliifolia and other Vitaceae species, such as Vitis, Cissus and Ampelopsis. In Florida larvae have been reported on Cissus sicyoides and Ampelopsis arborea.

Cautethia yucatana,species,wikipedia.org,"Cautethia yucatana is a species of moth in the family Sphingidae, which is known from California and Mexico south to Central America. It was described by Benjamin Preston Clark in 1919.
Female moths in this species have a wingspan of 16 millimetres. It is very similar to Cautethia spuria but smaller, and the forewings are shorter and more rounded. The forewing upperside ground color is smoky gray. The tornus has a dark bar, narrowing and continuing obscurely to the midpoint of the costal margin. The basal area of the hindwing upperside is pale yellow. There is a black marginal band extending almost to the discal cell.

Urania fulgens,species,wikipedia.org,"Urania fulgens, the urania swallowtail moth or green page moth, is a day-flying moth of the family Uraniidae. The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1854. It is found from Veracruz, Mexico, through Central America to northwestern South America (west of the Andes and south to Ecuador). It is highly migratory and has been recorded as a vagrant to the US state of Texas.
It is sometimes confused with the similar U. leilus, but that species is found east of the Andes in South America, is slightly larger, and has more white to the ""tail"". The two have been treated as conspecific.
As appears to be the case for all Urania, the larvae of U. fulgens feed exclusively on the toxic Omphalea species.

Sparganocosma docsturnerorum,species,wikipedia.org,"Sparganocosma is a genus of moths in the family Tortricidae. It contains only one species, Sparganocosma docsturnerorum, which is found in north-western Costa Rica.

The length of the forewings is 8.8–11 mm for males and 10.5–13 mm for females. The forewings have two large ovoid patches of pale buff in the costal region. These patches are infrequently separated by a narrow brown remnant of a median fascia. The patches usually have small flecks of brown. The remainder of the wing has a broad brown longitudinal band along the dorsum. The hindwings are rather uniformly dark grey brown. They are slightly darker in females.
The larvae have been recorded feeding on Asplundia utilis and Asplundia microphylla. They are pale translucent yellow gold with a nearly uniformly amber head.


== Etymology ==
The genus name is derived from Latin spargano (meaning to scatter or throw around) and cosm (referring to the universe). The species is named in honour of Drs. John Turner and Nancy Turner, who psychologically and financially supported the Lepidoptera inventory of Área de Conservación in Costa Rica.

Lusterala phaseolana,species,wikipedia.org,"Lusterala is a monotypic, neotropical genus of tortix moths provisionally assigned to tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae, with Lusterala phaseolana as sole species.
Genus and species were both described in 2007 by John Wesley Brown and Kenji Nishida. The holotype is conserved at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC. Based on DNA barcoding, the genus is possibly a synonym of Ecdytolopha.


== Behaviour and distribution ==
Lusterala phaseolana is known from Costa Rica. Its larvae are gall-inductive on the stems of their host plant, lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.).

Crocidosema plebejana,species,wikipedia.org,"The wingspan of adults is 12–16 mm. Males are dark brown to black with a white ocellus and dorsal patch. Females are pale brown to tan with a dark basal patch that does not extend to the costa. Julius von Kennel provides a full description.
In the seasonal parts of its range, this moth flies from midsummer to early autumn, e.g. from July to October in southern England. It is not quite clear whether there are several broods per year in the tropics, as it has been recorded on the Marquesas Islands only between January and April for example. The adults are active in the evening and are attracted to lights.
The larvae mainly feed inside the seed capsules and shoots of Malvaceae such as China jute (Abutilon theophrasti), marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis), the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea), arrowleaf sida (Sida rhombifolia), and various Gossypium (cottons) and Malva (typical mallows) species. The caterpillars have been found on other eurosids, including Crataegus hawthorns (Rosaceae), Cucurbita pepo pumpkins (Cucurbitaceae), and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae). They may occasionally become pests of cotton.",1110
Crocidosema plebejana,species,ukmoths.org.uk,"Wingspan 12-16 mm.

A fairly recent colonist to the British Isles, first discovered in south Devon in 1900.

It is now frequent in the south, and is expanding its range. It is thought to have been introduced from warmer climes.

The moths fly between July and October, and can be found on the wing from early evening, after which they will come to light.

The larvae feed on tree-mallow (Lavatera arborea) and related species, internally in the seed capsules and shoots.",470

Crocidosema lantana,species,wikipedia.org,"Crocidosema lantana, the lantana flower-cluster moth or lantana tortricid moth, is a moth of the family Tortricidae. It was first described by August Busck in 1910. It is native to Mexico and the southern United States, but was introduced to Hawaii in 1902, Australia in 1914 and the Caroline Islands in 1948 and 1949 to aid in the control of Lantana weeds. It has also been recorded from Yunnan, China and in Sri Lanka.
The larvae feed in pods of Bignonia chrysantha.

The length of the forewings is 13–16 mm for males and 16.5–18 mm for females.
The larvae feed on Bauhinia guianensis.


== Etymology ==
The species name is said to be derived from the Latin words albi and cephalus and refers to the white head region of this species. In classical Latin, albus (masculine), alba (feminine) or album (neuter) is the proper word for ""white"". Caput is the actual word for ""head"" in classical Latin, while in ancient Greek kephalē (κεφαλή) was used for ""head"". Kephalos (Κέφαλος) was the first name of various Greek mythological and historical figures that was rendered in Latin as Cephalus.

Disphragis bifurcata,species,wikipedia.org,"Disphragis bifurcata is a moth in the family Notodontidae first described by J. Bolling Sullivan and Michael G. Pogue in 2014. It is found from Guatemala to Colombia (Anchicaya, Valle and the Magdalena Valley), probably extending south into northern Ecuador. It is found at lower altitudes and moderate elevations up to about 1,000 meters.

The length of the forewings is 17.5 mm for males and 21.3 mm for females. The forewings have a broad tan subcostal streak from the base of the wing to the apex. The streak encloses a chocolate reniform spot and has several slightly darker brown lines crossing obliquely from the costa. The basal dash below the streak runs parallel to the costa. There is a white streak below the basal dash and a warm brown patch distal to the white streak, bordered by white. The hindwings are fuscous with a darker margin and veins and weak darker brown anal markings almost forming a spot at the anal angle.


== Etymology ==
The specific name bifurcata refers to the bifurcate tip of the socii, which is diagnostic.

Cryptoses choloepi,species,wikipedia.org,"Cryptoses choloepi is a sloth moth in the snout moth family that as an adult lives exclusively in the fur of sloths, mammals found in South and Central America.
Adult female moths live in the fur of the brown three-toed sloth Bradypus variegatus infuscatus and leave the fur of the sloth to lay eggs in the sloth droppings when the sloth descends, once a week, to the forest floor to defecate. The larvae of Cryptoses choloepi live in the dung and newly emerged moths later fly from the dung pile into the forest canopy to find a host sloth. In the early larval stages of Cryptoses, there are silken threads spun between two and three pellets, in which they form ""nets"" where they feed from.
The relationship between Cryptoses choloepi and sloths is ""phoretic rather than parasitic,"" because ""Cryptoses benefit from being carried by the sloth to fresh dung piles, the use of the sloths as a refuge from avian predators, and the enhancement of its diet with secretions or algae."" It has also been hypothesized that the presence of the moths benefits the sloth because they promote the growth of algae in the sloth's fur by depositing nitrogen thus enhancing the sloth’s ability to camouflage.

The larvae cause damage by feeding on new shoots of mahogany (Swietenia spp.) and cedro (also known as Spanish-cedar and tropical-cedar; Cedrela spp.). H. grandella feeds on the West Indies mahoganies in southern Florida, which restricts the reproduction of the mahogany population. The insects prefer a tree that gets full sun light, and isn't being shaded by a canopy level. 
The larvae are often called mahogany shoot borers, but the name may differ by country.

The wingspan is 14–18 mm. Adults are brownish.
The larvae feed on various species in the family Arecaceae, including Cocos, Attalea, Syagrus, Sabal and Serenoa species. They are one of the most important coconut pests. Young larvae feed on the carpels of still-tender flowers or, if the flower has already been fertilized, they penetrate the developing coconut through the lower part of the bracts. In young coconuts, the larvae feed on the mesocarp, opening a series of galleries and causing premature shedding of fruits.

Amyelois transitella,species,wikipedia.org,"Amyelois is a monotypic snout moth genus described by Hans Georg Amsel in 1956. Its single species, Amyelois transitella, the navel orangeworm, described by Francis Walker in 1863, is endemic to the tropical Western Hemisphere, including the southern United States. Its abundance in California increased greatly during the first half of the 20th century.

The wingspan is 9.7 to 10.9 mm. Adults are on wing from the end of March to the end of October in California.
The larvae are considered a commercial pest of a number of California crops, including walnut (Juglans regia), fig (Ficus carica), almond (Prunus dulcis) and pistachio (Pistacia vera).


== Pheromones ==
Female A. transitella release very similar sex pheromones to that of female Pyralis farinalis. Both species release the pheromone (Z,Z)-11,13-hexa decadienal which is used to attract males. Male P. farinalis have been observed attempting to mate with female A. transitella, but it does not seem as though these copulations are successful in producing offspring.

Galleria mellonella,species,wikipedia.org,"Galleria mellonella, the greater wax moth or honeycomb moth, is a moth of the family Pyralidae. G. mellonella is found throughout the world. It is one of two species of wax moths, with the other being the lesser wax moth. G. mellonella eggs are laid in the spring, and they have four life stages. Males are able to generate ultrasonic sound pulses, which, along with pheromones, are used in mating. The larvae of G. mellonella are also often used as a model organism in research.
The greater wax moth is well known for its parasitization of honeybees and their hives. Because of the economic loss caused by this species, several control methods including heat treatment and chemical fumigants such as carbon dioxide have been used.
The caterpillar of G. mellonella has attracted interest for its ability to degrade polyethylene plastic.


== Geographic range ==
G. mellonella was first reported as a pest in Asia, but then spread to northern Africa, Great Britain, some parts of Europe, northern America, and New Zealand. The species is now distributed throughout the globe. It has been reported in twenty-seven African countries, nine Asian countries, four North American countries, three Latin American countries, Australia, ten European countries, and five island countries. It is projected that the pest may spread further, especially due to climate change.


== Habitat ==
G. mellonella can be found where honeybees are cultivated.


== Food resources ==


=== Larvae ===
G. mellonella larvae parasitize the honeybee. Eggs are laid in the cracks and crevices inside the hive, which minimizes egg detection. Once eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the midrib of the wax comb, the cast skins of bee larvae, pollen, and small quantities of propolis and honey. They never eat bee larvae.


== Parental care ==


=== Oviposition ===
Shortly after emergence, G. mellonella females lay their eggs in the small cracks and crevices inside a beehive. Females prefer to lay their eggs in strong, healthy bee colonies over weaker colonies, but weaker colonies have a higher rate of G. mellonella infestation.  Eggs are laid in clusters of varying number depending on the region. Clusters of 50-150 eggs have been reported in the United States, whereas clusters of 300-600 eggs have commonly been reported in India. Up to 1800 eggs have been deposited by a single female.


== Life history ==
The life cycle of G. mellonella proceeds through four stages: egg, larvae, pupae and adult. Generally, eggs are laid in the early spring and the moth undergoes four to six generations annually. By December, the eggs, larvae, and pupae enter diapause in wait for warmer weather.


=== Factors that can affect length of life stages ===
The effects of temperature and humidity on life stages have been most thoroughly studied. Temperatures around 29–33 °C (84–91 °F) and humidity levels around 29-33% are optimal for development, though studies in Kansas have shown normal larval development at temperatures as high as 37 °C (99 °F). Average temperatures higher than 45 °C (113 °F) have been shown to be lethal for larva. Lower temperatures at 23 °C (73 °F), however, resulted in only part of the life cycle being completed. At temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F), even short exposures kill larva and adults.
Intraspecific factors also affect life stages: cannibalism of instars in the process of moulting has been seen, though only in situations where food is scarce. Diet quality also can affect larva development; nutrient deprived larvae are more susceptible to infection by the yeast Candida albicans.


=== Egg ===

Eggs are smooth and spherical in appearance, with a size ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 mm. Coloring ranges from pink to cream to white. They are laid in clusters in small cracks and crevices in the hive, and can take anytime from 7.2 to 21.8 days to hatch.


=== Larvae ===
Larva range in size from 3 to 30 mm long, and are white or dirty gray color. They feed on honey, pollen, cast off skin of honeybee larvae, and the midrib of the wax comb; cannibalism has also been observed in food shortages. Less often, they are found in bumblebee and wasp nests, or feeding on dried figs. Feeding is more intense during earlier instars compared to later instars. They can remain in the larval stage anywhere between 28 days to 6 months, during which they undergo eight to ten molting stages. While silk is spun during all stages, at the last instar the larvae spins a cocoon of silk for itself and enters the pupal stage.


=== Pupae ===
Pupae are immobile, do not feed, and remain housed in their cocoon for 1 to 9 weeks until emerging as adults. Size ranges from 14 to 16 mm. Pupae start off as a brownish white, but gradually darken to a dark brown color just before adults are ready to emerge.


=== Adult ===
Adult moths are brown gray and range from 10 to 18 mm in length. The adults' wingspan is 30 to 41 mm.Meyrick describes it - Forewings brown, suffusedly irrorated with ashy-whitish, especially on costal half towards base, and sprinkled with black, dorsal area much mixed with whitish-ochreous or ferruginous; some tufts of raised scales on fold; first and second lines angulated, faint, towards dorsum marked with short blackish dashes on veins and small dorsal spots, first sometimes almost obsolete. Hindwings in male pale fuscous, becoming dark posteriorly, in female fuscous-whitish, terminally fuscous. Larva pale dull grey; head and plate of 2 dark reddish-brown : in old honeycombs in beehives; 5-8.
This moth flies from May to October in the temperate parts of its range, such as Belgium and the Netherlands. Females are larger and heavier than males, and possess a characteristic beaklike head. The outer margin of the forewing is smooth and the labial palp is extended forwards. Males are identified by the semilunar notch. Females live for an average of 12 days; males live for an average of 21 days.


== Host ==
G. mellonella larvae parasitize wild honeybees. Eggs are laid within the hive, and the larva that hatch tunnel through the honeycombs that contain honeybee larva and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees, a phenomenon known as galleriasis. Tunnels also result in massive destruction of the combs. As a result, honey is wasted as it leaks out when cell caps are eaten. Finally, both G. mellonella adults and larvae can be vectors for pathogens that can infect honeybees, including the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and the black queen cell virus (BQCV).


== Enemies ==


=== Parasites ===
Apanteles galleriae parasitizes G. mellonella larva inside the beehive. 1-2 eggs, laid by the adult Apanteles galleriae, were found on each larva, with only one successfully parasitizing the host and surviving throughout its life cycle.  The parasite emerges and ruptures the host body, and pupates into a small cocoon. Parasitism increases gradually, starting in February, reaching its peak in May, then declining until July. However, it is unlikely that this parasite will take root in a strong, healthy colony as they will be kept out of the hive by bees. Even if they are able to enter the hive, it is difficult to navigate through the darkness in order to find their host.
Habrobracon hebetor also parasitizes G. mellonella adults, along with other members of the family Pyralidae. It uses male-secreted sex pheromones to locate its host.


== Mating ==
Males call for females with ultrasonic sound pulses that attract virgin females and initiate courtship Once females get closer, males produce a sex pheromone to initiate mating.  There are many known kinds of sex pheromone including nonanal, decanal, hexanal, heptanal, undecanal, 6,10,14 trimethylpentacanol-2 and 5,11-dimethylpentacosane. It is also known that these pheromones are often used to create traps to attract females. However, as traps baited with these pheromones do not attract virgin females over long distances, acoustics have to be used to draw females in first.


== Physiology ==


=== Sound generation ===
Males generate ultrasonic sound pulses at 75 kHz, 200μs per pulse that are used to attract females for mating. This is generated by twisting an end of the tymbal, the membrane that produces sound in insects, with the wings. This causes the tymbal to buckle and results in the emission of an ultrasonic pulse. However, isolated males will not generate sound, thus stimulation from other wax moths is required. Females respond to these pulses by fanning their wings, resulting in 40 and 80 Hz wingbeat frequencies that are detected by the males; which then produces sex pheromones so the female can find him.


=== Hearing organs ===
Both sexes are equipped with a sensitive tympanic hearing organ that allows the great wax worm to perceive high frequency sound. This likely resulted from selective pressure from insectivorous bats; being able to detect their echolocation would enable G. mellonella to avoid being eaten. Female tympanic membranes are 0.65 mm across; males’ are 0.55 mm across. They are located on the ventral side of the first abdominal segment.
Emitters that produced ultrasonic sounds at similar frequencies as echolocation prompted G. mellonella to tilt their head and then exhibit dropping, looping, and freezing behaviors, all of which are meant to evade predators. The head tilt was a direct response to sound reception; once tympanic hearing organs were destroyed, this response was lost. Notably, predator evading behaviors were not exhibited when G. mellonella was exposed to lower frequency ultrasounds of moderate intensity.
G. mellonella seems to be able to differentiate between different frequencies and pulsing patterns. It has been hypothesized that G. mellonella use the 30–100 Hz range for communication with other members of its species. This is an ideal frequency as honeybees, its host, generally do not produce sound in this range.


== Interactions with humans ==


=== Beekeeping ===
This species of moth is a major parasite of the wild and cultivated honey bee, costing millions of dollars of damage each year. It is said to be present in any area where beekeeping is practiced. After eggs are laid in the hive, the larvae burrow through the honeycombs and cause massive destruction, in addition to trapping emergent bees. Measures have been developed to prevent and manage infestations, but many have unresolved downsides.


=== Lab and Pet Food Source ===
Wax moth larvae are commonly raised and sold as food for captive reptiles and arthropods.


=== Management ===
G. mellonella causes massive economic losses in the honeybee cultivation industry; the Southern U.S. loses 4-5% of its profits per year due to this one pest. In order to prevent or manage infestations, cultivators are encouraged to maintain sanitary conditions for their bees, as it will keep the colony strong so they can keep G. mellonella out. Cracks and crevices should also be sealed so that adult G. mellonella cannot lay their eggs there. Combs should be replaced regularly and infested combs should be removed as soon as possible.
Temperature treatments also destroy G. mellonella at all stages of its life cycle. Heat treatment keeps the combs and beekeeping equipment at 45-80 °C for 1–4 hours, or in hot water for 3–5 hours. However, heating at this temperature can cause sagging and distortion of the wax. Cold treatment cools the combs to -15 to -7 °C for 2-4.5 hours.
Chemical fumigants also destroy all stages of G. mellonella and are economically convenient. At present, only CO2 is approved to treat infested colonies, because other chemicals leave residues that make their way into the honey produced and pose risks for the person treating the hive.
Usage of gamma radiation to sterilize male pupae, or the male sterilization technique (MST), has also been used to control Galleria mellonella populations. 350 Gy of ionizing radiation was found to be most effective, and a ratio of 4 sterilized males to 1 normal male to 1 female resulted in the greatest decrease of hatched eggs and larvae that became pupae.


== In research ==
The waxworms of the greater wax moth have been shown to be an excellent model organism for in vivo toxicology and pathogenicity testing, replacing the use of small mammals in such experiments. The larvae are also well-suited models for studying the innate immune system. In genetics, they can be used to study inherited sterility (cellular and humoral immunity are part of acquired immunity, which is only in vertebrates. Insects only have innate immunity).
Experiments with infected waxworms support the hypothesis that the bacterial stilbenoid 3,5-Dihydroxy-4-isopropyl-trans-stilbene has antibiotic properties that help minimize competition from other microorganisms and prevents the putrefaction of the insect cadaver infected by the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis, itself host for the Photorhabdus bacterium.
G. mellonella is reported to be capable of hearing ultrasonic frequencies approaching 300 kHz, possibly the highest frequency sensitivity of any animal.
In 2017 it was shown that the larvae could degrade polyethylene. Recent research by Dr. Federica Bertocchini has shown that enzymes contained in the greater wax moth larvae’s saliva can oxidize and depolymerize polyethylene at room temperature and neutral pH within hours.
Polyethylene is one of the most difficult plastics to break down. Investigations underway to determine if these enzymes can be used to biodegrade plastic waste.
Another closely related species of waxworm, Plodia interpunctella, has been the subject of research which isolated two strains of bacteria from its gut, Enterobacter asburiae and Bacillus species which have been demonstrated as capable of growing on and decomposing polyethylene plastic in a laboratory setting.

Dryocampa rubicunda,species,animaldiversity.org,"Adult rosy maple moths are extremely variable in color. Coloration in adults can range from unmarked white to bright yellow with dark pink maculation. The woolly body of rosy maple moths varies in color from bright yellow, to cream, to white. Their ventral side, legs, and antennae are usually rose pink. Upper wing color is also very variable; ranging from yellow to cream, to white with pink at the margins and bases of the wing. The amount of pink maculation on the wings ranges from dominant to nearly absent. Polymorphism does occur within different geographic regions. Unique to Missouri, subspeciesalbais either all white or white with very faint pink maculation.(Collins, et al., 1996;Cotinis, 2004)

Sexual dimorphism is present in wing shape and span of rosy maple moths. Males have slightly narrower wings compared to females, and also have less rounded hindwings. Ornamentation differences are also present. Males have bipectinate antennae, while females have simple antennae. Both male and female rosy maple moths have an average wingspan of 32 to 55 mm. Male forewing length ranges from 17 to 29 mm. The last instar ranges from 38 mm to 55 mm in length.(Collins, et al., 1996;Cotinis, 2004;VanDyke, 2006)

Rosy maple moth caterpillars, also known as green-striped mapleworms, have different coloration depending on their stage of development. Early stage larvae have black heads and bodies that are yellowish-cream with faint longitudinal green stripes. Fully-grown caterpillars have beige to bright red heads. Their bodies are yellow-green with seven dark green lines running lengthwise. The longitudinal line coloration can also range from frosty blue to blue green, or black. Prominent black horns are located dorsally on the second thoracic segment. Two rows of short spines run along each side of the body and the terminal abdominal segments have four larger spines. Other moths in the same family (Saturniidae) have similar horned larvae, but lack the stunning color of rosy maple moths.(""The Green Striped Maple Worm"", 1971;""The Greenstriped Mapleworm"", 2010;Hyche, 2000)",2092

They are pale russet in colour, with a wingspan of 18–27 millimeters. The colouration is extremely variable, ranging from off-white with indistinct markings to a strong rust brown. The markings may vary considerably in size. The second and third segments are elongate. The caterpillars are greenish-yellow with a broad green band on the back, and a narrow broken yellow line running down the center. Some specimens may also have a wine-red marking on the back. The colour of the pupae may range from green to reddish brown, sometimes with black markings.",587
Emmelina monodactyla,species,ukmoths.org.uk,"Wingspan 18-27 mm.

One of the commonest of the 'Plume' moths all over Britain, and one of the few to be found in the early part of the year, as the adults occur in all months.

Like most of the Pterophoridae, the wings are cleft or divided, but this can be difficult to see, as the moth often rests with the wings rolled up tightly. The wing colour is usually pale brownish, but can be darker. Each pair of spurs on the hind legs has one spur longer than the other. The abdomen has a pale buff dorsal longitudinal band with brown streaks along the midline.

It occurs in any suitable habitat where the larval foodplants, bindweeds (ConvolvulusandCalystegiaspp.), occur. Larvae have also been reported occasionally on Morning glory (Ipomoea),Chenopodiumspp. andAtriplexspp. They feed in two overlapping generations on leaves and flowers from late May to September.

The larvae are greenish yellow with a broad green dorsal band, which has a fine discontinuous yellow line along its centre. The dorsal pinacula can be black, or coloured the same as the adjacent integument. Some specimens have ruby red dorsal markings.

The pupa varies from green to reddish, sometimes with black markings.",1189

The diamondback moth has a wingspan of about 15 mm and a body length of 6 mm. The forewings are narrow, brownish gray and lighter along the anterior margin, with fine, dark speckles. A creamy-colored stripe with a wavy edge on the posterior margin is sometimes constricted to form one or more light-colored diamond shapes, which is the basis for the common name of this moth. The hindwings are narrow, pointed toward the apex, and light gray, with a wide fringe. The tips of the wings can be seen to turn upward slightly when viewed from the side. The antennae are pronounced.

Plutella xylostella,species,artfakta.se,"En vanligen tvåfärgad, förhållandevis smalvingad mal som under sommaren förmodligen finns i de flesta svenska trädgårdar, där den svärmar kring korsblommiga växter. Arten känns igen på de framåtsträckta antennerna och framvingens vågiga teckning.

Vingspann 11–15 mm, honan ofta något större än hanen och svagare tecknad. ­Huvudet och mellankroppen är beigefärgade, grå eller brunaktiga. Antennsträngen är vit med svartbruna segmentbaser; från antennernas mitt och utåt finns tre till fyra partier med mer eller mindre helt svarta segment. Framvingen är oftast uppdelad i två färgfält åtskilda av en vågig gränslinje. Längs bakkanten är framvingen beige, ljusbrun eller grå, och i de främre två tredjedelarna vanligen brun till gråbrun (gradvis ljusare mot framkanten). Utmed bakkanten finns på sin höjd ett fåtal små, svarta fläckar. Vingfransarna är jämnt brungrå med 4–5 mer eller mindre tydliga delningslinjer. Bakvingen är ljusare eller mörkare brungrå. Kålmal särskiljs lätt från andra senapsmalar på de smala framvingarna (minst fyra gånger så långa som breda).
Den fullvuxna larven är blekt grön med en mörkare rygglinje och ljusbrunt huvud med mörka fläckar. Nackplåten och analplåten är vitaktiga med bruna fläckar. Den unga larven är enhetligt grå till gul.
Genitalier: Hanens genitalklaffar har i det närmaste rak underkant och böjd överkant. Transtilla vid klaffens bas är långt utdragen. Vinculums undre del är brett U- eller V-formig med en liten tappformig saccus. Honans genitalier utmärks av ett långt och smalt utskott från en inbuktning mitt på bakkanten av sjunde bukplåten.",1595

The forewings are bone-ochreous, sprinkled with brownish fuscous scales, which are chiefly distributed in horse-shoe form around the outer end of the cell, reverting to the costa and dorsum at or before the middle and tending to radiate outward on the lines of the neuration. An outwardly waved series of spots lies beyond this shade, annulate below the costa, bowed in the middle and sloped backward to the dorsum before the tornus. There are two strong discal spots, one before the middle, the other at the end, of the cell, with a plical spot nearer to the first. There is also a series of six well-marked spots along the termen, at the base of the bone-ochreous cilia which are tipped with whitish. The hindwings are bone-whitish, with a slight brownish tinge.

Lethata trochalosticta,species,wikipedia.org,"Lethata trochalosticta is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1913. It is found in Panama and Costa Rica.
The wingspan is about 36 mm. The forewings are olivaceous dark yellowish green, with a slight steely sheen beyond the cell. A reddish brown shade from the middle of the base blends outward and downward with the olivaceous ground colour, changing above to rosy red along the costa to two-thirds. A conspicuous, round, rosy red spot lies at the end of the cell, with a dark fuscous spot in its centre, and a narrow even rim of reddish brown. Just below it, and again above the tornus, is a faint reddish suffusion. The hindwings are ochreous, with a slight fuscous suffusion.

Endrosis sarcitrella,species,wikipedia.org,"As type species of Endrosis, the white-shouldered house moth was originally included in the genus when it was established (by Jacob Hübner in 1825) as Alucita betulinella, a scientific name established by Johan Christian Fabricius under this name in 1787. But Hübner had misidentified Fabricius' species, which was in reality a tineid moth known today as Nemaxera betulinella. In addition to this case of mistaken identity, the white-shouldered house moth as discussed by Hübner had actually been named Tinea lactella by J. N. C. M. Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. Earlier still, Carl Linnaeus had described the white-shouldered house moth as Phalaena (Tinea) sarcitrella in 1758, but neither Denis and Schiffermüller nor Hübner did remember it. Later authors, who were aware of the earlier descriptions, supposed the taxon of Denis and Schiffermüller or that of Linnaeus to be this type of Endrosis.
Hübner, however, believed to have identified his white-shouldered house moths correctly with Fabricius' A. betulinella and disregarded T. lactella entirely. Thus, the taxon T. lactella (though not the white-shouldered house moth species as a whole) was not included in Endrosis at the genus' inception, and such a change of type species can only be made by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature – it is not permitted in the rules of zoological nomenclature to prevent the confusion and misinterpretations of scientific names that was frequent before the early 20th century.
Over the years, a number of supposed close relatives of the white-shouldered house moth were described. Soon enough, they were all grouped in Endrosis. What remained unclear was how many species there were, and whether any forms stood out. With reports of the species accumulating from all over the world, it was eventually realized that this moth must have tagged along Homo sapiens and spread with human habitation since prehistoric times. In this single global gene pool, few if any current authors recognize more than a single species, E. sarcitrella.",2056

Amauta cacica,species,wikipedia.org,"Amauta cacica, the sugar-cane borer moth, is a moth in the Castniidae family. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Panama.
The larvae feed on plantains and can cause moderate damage. Other recorded food plants include Heliconia griggsiana. They bore the roots of their host plant. From the initial penetration, larvae tunnel into the corm of the plantain and feed there until close to maturity. The mature larva tunnels upwards in the plantain stalk to an average height of one meter, where it makes an exit hole. The larva retreats back down the tunnel about 30 cm, where it pupates inside a case made of fibers from its host plant.

Maruca vitrata,species,wikipedia.org,"Maruca vitrata  is a pantropical insect pest of leguminous crops like pigeon pea, cowpea, mung bean and soybean. Its common names include the maruca pod borer, bean pod borer, soybean pod borer, mung moth, and the legume pod borer. The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1787.
It can cause losses of 20–80% on the harvests of cowpeas.
Its feeding sites on plants are flower buds, flowers and young pods. In some cases early instars feed on flower peduncles and young stems.


== Methods for control ==


=== Biological ===
Some parasitoids have been shown to serve as a biological control for Maruca vitrata. Parasitoid wasps families include Braconidae and Ichneumonidae; some parasitoid flies in the Tachinidae are also natural enemies of the moth. M. vitrata prefers to lay its eggs on the flowering bodies of the cowpea plant. Efforts have been made to deter M. vitrata from reproducing on the plant ranging from pesticides to a chemical specifically designed to sterilize the moth.


== Distribution ==

Worldwide in the tropics. Asia, Africa, North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, Australia & Oceania.

Diaphania indica,species,wikipedia.org,"The wingspan is about 30 mm. Adults have translucent whitish wings with broad dark brown borders. The body is whitish below, and brown on top of head and thorax as well as the end of the abdomen. There is a tuft of light brown ""hairs"" on the tip of the abdomen, vestigial in the male but well developed in the female. It is formed by long scales which are carried in a pocket on each side of the 7th abdominal segment, from where they can be everted to form the tufts. Unfertilized females are often seen sitting around with the tuft fully spread, forming two flower-like clumps of scales, which move slowly to spread their pheromones. These have been identified as consisting mainly of (E,E)-10,12-hexadecadienal and (E)-11-hexadecenal.
From its closest relatives, the cucumber moth is most reliably distinguished by microscopic examination of the genitals. In the male, the clasper's harpe is twice as long as it is wide, with the costa and sacculus running almost in parallel and being strongly sclerotized, and a rounded cucullus. From the center of the harpe, which is otherwise only weakly sclerotized, a thin spine extends. The uncus is covered in bristles and ends in a small tube; it is a bit longer than the tegumen which in turn is about as wide as it is long. The vinculum is almost quadratic, and the anellus forms a small triangular plate which is more strongly sclerotized. The aedeagus is almost straight, strongly sclerotized below, and has a flattened curved process at end.

Larval feeding on host plants causes plant death, which makes S. multiplicalis a good candidate for biological control of weedy water plants like Salvinia molesta, an invasive water fern in Australia. However, high rates of parasitism in the moth compromise its ability to effectively control water weeds. S. multiplicalis larvae are a pale yellow to green color, and adults develop tan coloration with darker patterning. The lifespan, from egg to the end of adulthood is typically three to four weeks. The species was first described by Achille Guenée in 1854.


== Geographic range ==
Samea multiplicalis was first observed in Brazil in 1854, and has since been documented across the southeastern United States, as far west as Louisiana. This region constitutes its native range. In 1981, the moth was introduced in Australia as a potential method of biological control of the water fern, S. molesta. It is now common throughout Queensland and New South Wales. In Australia, it has been found to thrive in tropical climates, with slower growth and dispersal in more temperate climates.


== Habitat ==
S. multiplicalis primarily lives on the water plants, Azolla caroliniana (water velvet), Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), Salvinia rotundifolia (water fern) in their native range, and Salvinia molesta (a water fern) in Australia. These plants grow to form floating mats on the surface of calm or still bodies of water like ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. S. multiplicalis can survive within a temperature range of 11-36 °C, however it survives best around temperatures of 30 °C. It requires warm conditions to survive and develop, however steady temperatures above the low 30s cause populations to crash. Moth populations can survive year round in habitats where food resources and adequate temperatures are sustained through the winter.


== Food resources ==


=== Host plant ===

In its native habitat, S. multiplicalis prefers the water lettuce P. stratiotes over other aquatic plants for feeding and oviposition, and in its introduced habitat in Australia, it primarily feeds and lays eggs on the water fern Salvinia molesta. P. stratiotes has a rosette of leaves surrounding a short, central stem and a submerged root system. Leaves are covered in short hairs. S. molesta plants in Australia are all clones, meaning they are genetically identical. However, there is some phenotypic variation due to differing temperature and nitrogen availability across its range, which is important due to S. multiplicalis larvae's preference for high-nitrogen food sources.


=== Food preferences ===
Caterpillars of the salvinia stem-borer moth feed on several aquatic plants, primarily Azolla caroliniana (water velvet), Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), Salvinia rotundifolia (water fern), Salvinia molesta (a water fern), and occasionally Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth). Feeding by colonies of larvae often leads to intensive damage and plant death after two or three weeks of feeding. Larvae eat by boring into plant stems or feeding externally on leaves.


=== Protection while feeding ===
Often, groups of larvae display cooperative behavior when they feed in groups. They collectively construct a silk canopy over their feeding site while they eat, expanding it as they exhaust their current site and move on to new areas of their host plant. This behavior offers protection from predation, decreasing larval mortality.


=== Larval nutrition ===
Nitrogen is very important nutrient for larval development, especially during the first two instars, so larvae prefer food plants with higher nitrogen content. Higher nitrogen intake correlates with larger larval biomass and faster development, both of which are favored because they decrease larval vulnerability to predation. Additionally, a lack of sufficient nitrogen intake during early development leads to decreased ability to digest and utilize food throughout the rest of the insect's life.


=== Compensatory feeding ===
Water lettuce and other aquatic plants tend to have high water content, which dilutes the nitrogen and other nutrients they contain. To account for this, S. muliplicalis has a higher feeding rate than many other Lepidoptera species. When nitrogen levels are especially low, larvae show compensatory feeding behavior, increasing their already high feeding rate and consuming a larger volume in order to make up for the nutrient deficit. This behavior does not usually mitigate the poor quality food, however, and larvae on nitrogen-depleted host plants still experience slower development and decreased digestive efficiency.


== Life history ==


=== Larvae ===

Larvae hatch approximately four days after eggs are laid. Larvae have an off-white or pale yellow color during early instars and develop a yellow-green color as they mature. They typically develop through five instars over the course of about two weeks, and male larvae develop faster than females by about two days. In low-nitrogen conditions, larvae require a sixth instar and two or three additional days to develop.


=== Pupae ===
Caterpillars construct a silk cocoon inside of a leaf petiole on their host plant in order to pupate. Pupation lasts between four and ten days, with females developing faster than males. Time spent in this stage of development is not dependent on larval nutrition.


=== Adults ===
After they emerge from their cocoons, adult salvinia stem-borer moths spend the rest of their three- or four-week life span around their host plants, mating and laying eggs. Female moths lay an average of 150 eggs over the course of several days on the surfaces of host plant leaves or among hairs or leaflet structures. Moths prefer the host plant P. stratiotes for laying eggs due to its structure which provides abundant oviposition surfaces. Moths are not known to oviposit on E. crassipes. Adults are tan with darker markings on both sets of wings and a wingspan of about 20 mm. Adult size is not significantly affected by larval nutrition levels, however insufficient nitrogen during larval development does lead to reduced egg production in female moths.


== Enemies ==


=== Parasites ===
S. multiplicalis is affected by a number of parasites, most commonly by wasp species of the order Hymenoptera and parasitic flies of the order Diptera, as well as miscrosporidia. Parasitic wasps attack S. multiplicalis larvae during their first instar and pre-pupal wasps emerge during the caterpillars' last instar, killing their hosts. Parasitism rates are fairly high in some populations, which diminishes their effectiveness at controlling weedy host plants. S. multiplicalis larvae are parasitized in both their native and introduced ranges by similar species. Parasitism rates remain steady through spring, summer, and fall and decrease slightly during winter months.


== Interactions with humans ==


=== Biological control agent ===

S. molesta is an aquatic plant native to Brazil that is invasive in Australia due to a lack of sufficient herbivory to control the growth of the plant. It has become a common weed in many bodies of water, especially in eastern Australia in Queensland and New South Wales. The water fern grows in expansive mats, potentially crowding out other native aquatic plants and preventing light penetration in water bodies where it grows. Efforts to control S. molesta began in 1980 with the introduction of the salvinia weevil Cyrtobagous salviniae, which is also native to Brazil. S. multiplicalis was introduced the following year in 1981 to aid in the biological control of the weed.


== Comparison with C. salviniae ==
Since their introduction, C. salviniae and S. multiplicalis have had different levels of effectiveness; the weevil has proved more useful than the moth at keeping salvinia populations down through intensive feeding. While C. salviniae and S. multiplicalis both have similar habitat needs, including common host plants, similar nitrogen requirements, and an optimal temperature of 30 °C, S. multiplicalis populations are highly susceptible to parasites and parasitoids, which prevent the colony growth and dispersal that would be required for effective weed control. S. multiplicalis actually has a higher rate of reproduction and dispersal than C. salviniae, but infection prevalence still prevents sufficient levels of feeding to significantly affect S. molesta numbers.

Utetheisa ornatrix,species,wikipedia.org,"Utetheisa ornatrix, also called the ornate bella moth, ornate moth, bella moth or rattlebox moth, is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae. It is aposematically colored ranging from pink, red, orange and yellow to white coloration with black markings arranged in varying patterns on its wings. It has a wingspan of 33–46 mm. Moths reside in temperate midwestern and eastern North America as well as throughout Mexico and other parts of Central America. Unlike most moths, the bella moth is diurnal. Formerly, the bella moth or beautiful utetheisa of temperate eastern North America was separated as Utetheisa bella. Now it is united with the bella moth in Utetheisa ornatrix.
The larvae usually feed on Crotalaria species, which contain poisonous alkaloid compounds that render them unpalatable to most predators. Larvae may prey on other bella moth larvae in order to compensate for any alkaloid deficiency.
The bella moth also demonstrates complex mating strategies and is thus an excellent model to study sexual selection. Females mate multiply and receive spermatophores containing sperm, nutrients and alkaloid compounds from numerous males as nuptial gifts. Females choose males according to the intensity of a courtship pheromone, hydroxydanaidal, and carry out a sperm selection process after copulation with various males.


== Distribution ==
Utetheisa ornatrix is found from southeastern United States to South America (southeast Brazil). In the southeastern United States, its distribution ranges from Connecticut westward to southeastern Nebraska and southward to southern New Mexico and Florida. This species is found to be more common in more tropical parts of this range, in accordance to the availability of its host plant in more southern regions. It is also found throughout Mexico, South America, and Central America.


== Taxonomy ==
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus first characterized two species of the genus Phalaena. Phalaena ornatrix was used to describe the paler moth specimens, and Utetheisa bella, described the bright pink moth specimens. In 1819, Hübner moved these species to a new genus, Utetheisa.  For nearly a century, it was difficult to determine this moth's evolutionary history as researchers focused on external similarities (color, shape, patterns, size), rather than determining features specific to the species. This led to great confusion when trying to categorize the different subspecies. In 1960, Forbes combined both species, Utetheisa ornatrix and Utetheisa bella, into the species now known as Utetheisa ornatrix. His conclusion was also supported by Pease Jr. who, in 1966, used genetic testing and determined that any phenotypic differences were based on interspecific variation due to geographic differences (rather than intraspecific variation).


=== Subspecies ===
Utetheisa ornatrix ornatrix
Utetheisa ornatrix bella (Linnaeus, 1758)
Utetheisa ornatrix saintcroixensis Pease, 1973


== Description ==


=== Eggs ===
The eggs of the Utetheisa ornatrix are spherical in shape and range in colour from white to yellow to sometimes brown.


=== Larvae ===
The larvae are orange and brown with irregular black bands on each segment of the body. The anterior and posterior portions of the black binds are also marked with distinct white spots. Full grown larvae reach 30-35mm in length. Although most arctiid larvae have verrucae, Utetheisa ornatrix larvae lack these.


=== Pupae ===
The pupae are mostly black marked with irregular orange and brown bands. Usually, the pupae are covered with a loose layer of silk.


=== Adult ===
These moths are aposematic and use their bright coloration to warn predators of their unpalatability. Their wings range in color from yellow, red, pink, and orange to white.  Wings contain white bands containing six bands of irregularly spaced black spots. The hind wings can be bright pink with a marginal black band. The adult Utetheisa ornatrix has a wingspan of 33 to 46 millimetres (1.3 to 1.8 in).


== Predation ==

During the larval stages, caterpillars feed on leguminous plants of the genus Crotalaria. These plants contain large amounts of toxins, particularly pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which are found in high concentrations in the seeds. Bella moth caterpillars sequester these toxins and use them as a deterrent for predators. When the adult is disturbed, they secrete a foam containing the toxins from their head, which makes them unpalatable to predators. Since PAs are an extremely valuable resource, individual larvae compete with one another to colonize an entire pod, an elongated seed-containing pouch from the food plant. Larvae that are unable to take ownership of a pod must obtain the chemicals from leaves, where they are found at much lower densities. These caterpillars sequester smaller amounts of PAs and are more susceptible to predation.
Although it is beneficial to feed on seeds, larvae do not enter the pods immediately after they hatch. During the first larval instars, caterpillars feed on leaves and it is not until the second or third instar that they enter the pods. The evolutionary benefits of this strategy are not understood. When caterpillars metamorphose into adult moths, they carry the alkaloids with them, which continue to protect them during the adult stage.
PAs render the bella moth unpalatable to many of its natural enemies like spiders and insectivorous bats. Spiders that capture bella moth larvae or adults release them soon after, leaving them unharmed. In contrast, bella moth individuals grown on a PA-free diet are readily preyed on by spiders. Similarly, bats that catch bella moth individuals quickly release these unpalatable moths without harming them. Unlike other moths of the Arctiidae, the bella moth does not possess an acoustic aposematism system that would enable it to avoid bats altogether. Bella moth larvae and some predators like loggerhead shrikes are not negatively affected by PAs.
The bella moth is able to detoxify PAs due to the possession of the gene pyrrolizidine-alkaloid-N-oxygenase. It has been experimentally shown that bella moth larvae upregulate the expression of this gene when the amount of PAs in their diet increases. In addition, it has been shown that PA rich diets do not have a negative effect on the fitness of these moths, but only affect time of development, which increases with increasing PA concentration in diet. However, caterpillars with longer development times reach similar pupal sizes compared to those with shorter developmental times due to diets containing smaller amounts of PAs.


=== Cannibalism ===
On occasion, bella moth caterpillars cannibalize other eggs, pupae or larvae from the same species.  Since PAs are a limited resource, some caterpillars do not reach optimal levels and resort to cannibalism.  This behavior is a consequence of PA deficiency rather than hunger, since deficits in alkaloids are the main cause of mortality. Pupae cannibalism is rare because larvae normally pupate far away from the plant where they feed.  Egg cannibalism is also rare because eggs provide larvae with very small quantities of PAs and because eggs from the same cluster hatch synchronously.  Larvae may also feed on other bella moth larvae that are laden with alkaloids. This is more common since feeding on one single larva is sufficient to compensate for the cannibalistic caterpillar's alkaloid deficiency.


=== Kin recognition ===
Bella moth caterpillars may have the ability to recognize other larvae as kin, as larvae are less likely to intrude upon siblings than non-siblings established in seedpods.


== Mating ==
Bella moths of both sexes use very complex reproductive strategies, making this species an excellent model system for studying sexual selection. Females mate multiply over their three- to four-week lifespan as adults. They mate with an average of three to four males, each of whom provides her with a nuptial gift, a spermatophore containing sperm, nutrients, and alkaloids. Adult males invest up to 11% of their body mass to create a spermatophore they provide to a female during mating.  The nutrients given in the spermatophore allow the female to produce, on average, an additional 32 eggs.


=== Mating system ===
The bella moth presents a polyandrous mating system, where females mate with multiple males. On average, females mate with four to five males over their lifespan of three to four weeks but can mate with and receive up to thirteen spermatophores. Since spermatophores contain nuptial gifts of pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) and nutrients, multiple mating helps the female increase the fitness of her offspring. In addition, multiple mating also benefits the female directly. Since the spermatophores are sizeable and can be digested within the female, multiple mating allows females to accrue the resources necessary to build additional eggs. This is equivalent to a 15% increase in egg production. In addition, multiple mating results in increased transmission of alkaloidal gifts to eggs. However, this does not mean that there is segregated allocation of these gifts. Instead, the PA obtained from numerous males is allocated in admixture so that eggs tend to receive from more than one male source. In contrast, normally most of the sperm used to fertilize the eggs comes from a single male.


=== Courtship ===
Courtship begins at dusk. Stationary females release a sexual pheromone that lures males. They emit these chemicals in short pulses to provide close-range orientation cues to male moths as they seek out the females. When a male reaches a female, he flutters around her and thrusts two peculiar tufts of scales from his coremata, two yellow spherical structures by the male's genital organs. By doing so, the male emits a specific scent from his coremata that is attributed to a pheromone, hydroxydanaidal.  After receiving the scent, the female proceeds to mating.
Copulation lasts for up to 12 hours.  It takes the male about two hours to transfer the spermatophore containing all of the sperm and nutrients he is going to offer to the female. The remaining hours of copulation are exclusively used for alkaloid transfer. These alkaloids distribute themselves evenly around the female body, even the wings, and offer her great protection as they render her unpalatable to most predators. Eventually, the female allocates about one third of the alkaloids she receives to her ovaries, where they will be used to confer protection to the eggs.


=== Female pheromonal chorusing ===
Bella moth mating behavior is exceptional in that females compete with other females to obtain more males, as opposed to males competing with males.  As in many other moth species, females release sexual pheromones that males can detect over long distances.  However, in most species, females do not interact with one another during pheromone release. Female bella moths are unique in that females from the same family often engage in collective pheromone release termed “female pheromonal chorusing”.
This phenomenon is a consequence of a female-biased operational sex ratio. This means that at any given time, there are more females than males seeking to copulate. This occurs because males lose up to 11% of their body mass during mating and once they are done mating, they need time to sequester resources that will allow them to deliver a spermatophore to the next female they mate with. On the contrary, females do not need time to prepare for their next copulation. Due to the unequal mating rates, males become valuable to females and female-to-female competition rises dramatically as a consequence.
Engaging in pheromonal chorusing allows females to increase the attractiveness of genetic relatives and increase their indirect fitness. Females may also, but less frequently, engage in female chorusing with unrelated females. It has been suggested that chorusing is still beneficial under these circumstances, because cooperation for pheromone release may increase the attractiveness of the entire group and increase each moth's individual fitness.  It has been experimentally shown that when females detect other female pheromones they increase the rate of pheromone release and call for longer periods of time. Such observations support the hypothesis that females cooperate with one another to increase mating success.


== Sexual selection ==


=== Precopulatory ===
Although most female moths mate multiply, very low instances of mixed paternities occur.  In fact, most progeny in a single clutch is sired exclusively by one male. Females of this species do not select based on age, mating order, between-mating interval, or duration of copulation.  Instead, female Utetheisa ornatix demonstrate female choice in mate selection that depends on body size, systemic content of defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloid, and glandular content of the courtship pheromone hydroxydanaidal.  Selecting for these males provides the females with multiple benefits such as obtaining sperm packages with more defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloids which results in larger offspring. Offspring fathered by larger males are generally less vulnerable to predation because of their higher alkaloid content, allowing the offspring to have higher viability and fitness.
Larger males with the highest alkaloid content can be distinguished by a specific pheromonal scent that predicts the content of the alkaloidal gifts: hydroxydanaidal (HD). There is a relationship between the size of the male, the type of food the males fed on as larvae, and the composition of its spermatophores. For example, males that fed inside a seed pod rather than on leaves produce higher levels of HD. In addition, these males have higher adult weights and have higher systemic loads of PA, the metabolic precursor of HD. By selecting for HD-rich males, the female moth ensures the receipt of a large alkaloid gift (phenotypic benefit) and genes that encode for large size (genetic benefit).
The female's mating preference is inherited paternally since the preference gene or genes lie mostly or exclusively on the Z sex chromosome. The preferred male trait and the female preference for the trait are strongly correlated; females with larger fathers have a stronger preference for larger males.


=== Postcopulatory ===
After copulating with several males, rival sperm carried by a female do not compete directly for access to the eggs.  Females direct a postcopulatory selective process where they choose male sperm based on the intensity of the courtship pheromone that was released prior to copulation, hydroxydanaidal (HD). The intensity of this signal is directly proportional to the amount of alkaloids sequestered by the moth during the larval stages. As a consequence, this pheromone is an indirect indicator of success during larval development and will ultimately determine which sperm will be passed on to the offspring. Once they have selected a male, females use their musculature to channel the selected sperm through the chambers and constructs of their reproductive systems to their eggs.


== Parental investment ==
The eggs of the bella moth contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) that the mother delivers. The alkaloid is stored during the larval stages and retained through metamorphosis, protecting both larvae and adults from predators.  Female moths receive alkaloids from the males at the time of mating as part of the spermatophore. Although the male's contribution of PAs is less than that of the female, it still contributes significantly to egg protection.


=== Spermatophore ===
The spermatophore that males give to the females when mating contains sperm, nutrients, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), and accounts for up to 11% of the male's body mass. PA plays an important role in preventing predation in Utetheisa ornatrix because it is poisonous to most organisms. Males transmit PA to the females via a sperm package; the females then give this mating gift to the eggs, along with their own alkaloidal supplement and is utilized to protect the offspring from predation. In addition, females also personally benefit from the gift through protection and nutrition. After mating with a PA-rich male, the received PA is quickly allocated to all body parts. As a result, females become and remain unacceptable as prey to numerous organisms such as spiders. Another problem that females face is the risk of incurring a PA deficit due to the large amount of eggs they lay. Spermatophores is one way for females to compensate for this loss in PA.


== Host plants ==

Plants of the genus Crotalaria are the major hosts for the Utetheisa ornatrix, although a variety of plants in the family Fabaceae have also been cited in literature. The word Crotalaria originates from the Greek root “crotal,” which means “a rattle” and is characteristic of the pods found on these plants. The Crotalaria host plants contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are used by the Utetheisa ornatrix to repel predators. Specific host plants used include:

Crotalaria avonensis (Avon Park rattlebox)
Crotalaria rotundifolia (rabbitbells)
Crotalaria lanceolata
Crotalaria pallida (smooth rattlebox)
Crotalaria spectabilis (showy rattlebox)
Crotalaria retusa


== Pyrrolizidine alkaloids and humans ==
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are the toxins the bella moth is able to ingest and use for protection from predators. They are known to be the principal toxins found in plants that can cause disease in humans and other animals. Reported pathways for human exposure include crop contamination, milk and honey contamination and some traditional herbal medicines. Once ingested, the alkaloids affect mainly the liver and the lungs. Human poisoning can cause veno-occlusive disease and teratogenicity.

Bertholdia trigona,species,wikipedia.org,"Bertholdia trigona, or Grote's bertholdia, is a species of moth in the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1879. It is prevalent in the southwestern United States.
In studies performed at Wake Forest University, these moths were shown to have developed the ability to disrupt the echolocation of bats. This insect is one of several moths known to jam its predator's echolocation and has the highest recorded click rate of any moth species, a feature hypothesized to increase the effectiveness of jamming.

This moth was used in the insignia of the RAF 360 Squadron, whose task was to develop equipment and tactics to jam enemy radars during the Cold War period. The inspiration was the observation that Melese laodamia produces ultrasound when handled. The ultrasound was thought to jam the sonar of insectivorous bats.

Lophocampa propinqua,species,wikipedia.org,"Lophocampa propinqua is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Henry Edwards in 1884. It is known from Mexico and Central America.


== Taxonomy ==
Edwards described Lophocampa propinqua as a variation of Lophocampa caryae based on a single male from Mexico. The taxon propinqua was placed by Allan Watson and David T. Goodger as a valid species in the genus Lophocampa. The different forewing pattern, in particular the interrupted medial band, the narrower uncus and the longer valvae of the male genitalia justify this placement as a species distinct from the North American Lophocampa caryae.

== Taxonomy ==
The type species, Hemihyalea cornea, has been proposed for inclusion in Amastus, and other species that were previously classified in Hemihyalea have consequently been moved to the re-established genus Pseudohemihyalea. It is unclear at present whether Hemihyalea is a valid genus at all, and if so, which species other than H. cornea it would contain.

Hemihyalea cornea is found in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.

Chlamydastis arenaria,species,wikipedia.org,"Chlamydastis arenaria is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1913. It is found in Panama and Brazil (Espirito Santo).
The wingspan is 21–23 mm. The forewings are sandy ochraceous, becoming white toward the apex, with oblique shades of mixed ochreous and greyish brown coming from the costa—the first, at one-fourth from the base, short and broken, terminating in a spot of black scales on the disc. The second, about the middle, somewhat more emphasised, and accompanied by small groups of black scales tending in the direction of an elongate black scale-patch, which reaches to the termen a little below the middle. The third costal shade, arising at about three-fourths, tends outward to below the apex, but is separated by the white ground colour, which also appears between the three oblique shades on the costa itself. Below and above the fold, near the base, are a few raised ochreous scales, and the first and second bands are also accompanied by some raised scales. The termen is slightly spotted. The hindwings are brownish grey.

Antaeotricha fascicularis,species,wikipedia.org,"Antaeotricha fascicularis is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1854. It is found in Guyana, French Guiana and Brazil (Amazonas). It is located in rainforests where they can thrive due to the abundance of vegetation and a large amount of suitable host plants for the moths larvae, where the newly hatched caterpillars then feed of their host plant 
The wingspan is about 30 mm. The forewings are fuscous, towards the costa anteriorly suffused with purplish, towards the costa posteriorly and termen brownish. The costal edge is dark fuscous except towards the apex and there is a white dot towards the costa at one-third and a very fine white line along the fold from the base to near the middle. The discal stigmata are obscurely darker, connected by a white line, the second followed by a short white dash. There are several white dashes between the second discal and the tornus. A cloudy somewhat interrupted curved white line is found from beneath the costa at four-fifths to the tornus. The hindwings are fuscous, rather darker posteriorly.

Sitotroga cerealella,species,wikipedia.org,"The ovoid eggs are initially white when laid, but soon turn towards a shade of red and measure approximately 2 millimetres (3⁄32 in) long.
Though rarely seen due to their growth stages taking place within a single grain, larvae of the Angoumois grain moth are yellowish-white with a small yellowish-brown head and 10–15 millimetres (3⁄8–9⁄16 in) in length. The average lifespan of the adult Angoumois grain moth is 15 days, with a maximum of 30 days if living under the optimal temperature.
Adult Angoumois grain moths have a wingspan from 10–15 millimetres (13⁄32–19⁄32 in) and a body length of 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–13⁄32 in). Like most moths, they have 4 wings, 6 legs and are brownish-grey, or pale brown in colour. They exhibit dark spots on their tapering forewings, about two-thirds from the base of their wings. Their uniquely curved hind wings give them a distinguishing characteristic from other moths, with hairs along the edge of the wings. The forewings are golden-yellow, with their light grey hind wings giving the whole moth an overall brown colour. Adult males are differentiated by a black thin and pointed abdomen whereas adult females express a colourless bulky and long abdomen.",1200

Tecia solanivora,species,wikipedia.org,"Tecia solanivora, the Central American potato tuberworm, Guatemalan tuber moth, or Guatemalan potato moth, is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Povolný in 1973. It is found from Guatemala, through Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama) to South America, where it has been recorded from Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru. It has also been introduced on the Canary Islands and mainland Spain.
The Guatemalan tuber moth, in sufficiently large infestations, can lead to a complete yield loss. Although there is natural variation in the tolerance of potato varieties to feeding by Guatemalan tuber moths, higher tolerance is associated with decreased yield in the absence of infestation. In some potato varieties, notably Pastusa Suprema, infestation of a small number of tubers on each plant can cause uninfested tubers on the infested plants to become larger, leading to increased yield (up to around 20%). Changes in photosynthesis and increased starch accumulation in uninfested tubers begin within days of Guatemalan tuber moth infestation. Tuber infestation by Guatemalan tuber moths also increases above-ground potato resistance to feeding by two other lepidopteran pests, beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua) and fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda).

It is found in warm areas in Mexico, California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Hawaii, Cuba, Hispaniola and the Bahamas. It has also been reported from greenhouses in Delaware, Mississippi, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
The wingspan is 9–12 mm. There are seven to eight generations per year.
The larvae feed on Solanaceae species, including Lycopersicon esculentum, Solanum melongena, Solanum tuberosum, Solanum carolinense, Solanum xanthii, Solanum umbelliferum and Solanum bahamense. Young larvae use silk to spin a tent. Under the cover of this tent they create a tunnel into a leaf of their host. They may also enter stems or fruits.

The wingspan is about 12 mm. The forewings have a leaden grey basal patch, merging outwardly into tawny purplish fuscous, which reaches to one-third and is
bounded on the costa by a cuneiform white costal streak, while from its lower half it sends obliquely upward a sharp steel-grey tooth-like projection into the deep brownish orange band which succeeds it. From each extremity of the white costal streak a dark steel-grey point also projects outward and the broad orange band into which these project is bounded a little beyond the middle of the wing by a rather oblique bright steel-grey fascia, narrowly margined on either side by black, and rather wider on the dorsum than on the costa. This again is succeeded by a deep reddish orange fascia, narrower than the preceding orange band, but somewhat produced outward on the dorsum. Above this dorsal extension is a deep blackish patch extending to the costa and produced outward nearly to the apex, this contains a pair of rather converging silvery white costal streaks and a small spot of steel-grey towards its lower extremity, the space beyond it to the apex and termen, including the cilia, being rich shining purple. The hindwings are dark coppery brown.

Gonioterma compressa,species,wikipedia.org,"Gonioterma compressa is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1913. It is found in Venezuela and Mexico (Tabasco).
The wingspan is about 18 mm. The forewings are pale stone grey, with pale rust-brown markings which tend to throw up rather more intensely coloured rust-brown scales along their margins. These consist of first, an irregular, large, dorsal patch covering two-fifths of the dorsum, throwing out a slight angle on the fold, and a stronger projecting angle upward nearly to the costa, but not reaching the base. Secondly, a broken and rather outwardly oblique fasciate shade a little beyond the middle, forming a costal spot, an inwardly projecting patch at the end of the cell, and a short length-spot on the dorsum, connected to the cell-spot by a narrow sinuate line. Thirdly, a costal spot before the apex, connected with the tornus by an outwardly convex narrow line of spots on the veins. Around the apex and termen is also a line of semidetached brown spots. The costa is narrowly tinged with ochreous. The hindwings are pale brownish grey.

The wingspan is about 20–21 mm. The forewings are stone whitish, with a very pale fawn-brownish suffused shade. A fuscous shade on the cell at one-fourth, with a smaller one on the fold, below and a little beyond it, is succeeded by another at the end of the cell, beyond which is a curved series of very indistinct fawn-brownish shade streaks at the base of the diverging veins. Beyond these is a series of dots of the same colour, commencing with three from the costa, forming an angle below it a little darker than the remainder, which, curving outward opposite to the middle of the termen, revert to the dorsum before the tornus. A further series of brownish-fuscous dots, two costal and seven terminal, extends around the margin. The hindwings are whitish grey.

The genus name is a homonym of Tetrisia Walker, 1867, a genus of plataspid bugs, published four months earlier, so the moth name must be formally replaced.
The species Dysschema tricolora (Sulzer, 1776) has been mistakenly listed in the literature under the genus Tetrisia.

Eudocima apta,species,wikipedia.org,"Eudocima apta is a moth of the  family Erebidae. It is found in large parts of Brazil. At times it migrates north into the United States. The wingspan is about 45 mm.


== Classification ==
Some older authors have considered Eudocima apta as a synonym of E. materna but more recent workers consider apta as a New World species that is very similar in appearance to materna (Eudocima apta (Walker, [1858]) = Eudocima materna of authors, not Linnaeus, 1767). Eudocima materna is therefore the Old World counterpart of apta, and a simple visual comparison of materna and apta reveals obvious differences of the two species in both sexes. Zilli and Hogenes (2002) also report genitalic differences between the two species, most notably in the bursa.

General colour grey, faintly tinged with red. Anterior wings with a remarkable irregular black bar running from the tips to the shoulders, crossing the thorax horizontally, and parallel with the anterior edges; on the middle of this edge is a triangular dark brown spot edged with black, and nearer the body is a smaller one of the same shape and colour: a second narrower black line is situate about half an inch below, and parallel with the first, rising on the posterior edges, and extending across the wings almost to the external ones. Posterior wings with a black irregular bar arising near the external corners, and crossing them in a straight direction, meeting at the extremity of the abdomen; just above this, and almost close to it, is a very small and narrow waved black line running parallel with it, but towards the end suddenly turns off, and reaches the anterior edges. Besides the above markings there are a number of lighter and darker shades interspersed on the different parts of the wings. 
Underside: Palpi reddish, the extremities brown. Tongue spiral. Legs dark brown, mottled with red. Breast, abdomen, and sides red. Wings greyish red, with black indented lines and bars running parallel with the edges of the wings, and regularly placed one above another. Anterior wings having a black spot near their centre shaped like a kidney bean, with a small round one at a little distance nearer the body. Posterior having likewise a small black spot about half an inch from the base. Margins of the wings rather deeply scolloped. Wingspan 5+1⁄2inches (140 mm).",1717

Some systems of Microtubing to help irrigate commercial crops have been compromised, as the larvae of S. sueroides had damaged the pipes in the citrus groves of south Florida. The caterpillars had munched holes in the plastic tubing to penetrate the pipes and then pupate. They seemed to prefer black tubing compared to coloured tubing.

Anticarsia gemmatalis,species,wikipedia.org,"Anticarsia gemmatalis is a tropical species of caterpillar and moth that migrates north each season. The species can commonly be found in the Gulf states, north as far as Wisconsin. The adults have wings that are grayish brown, crossed with brown or black zigzag lines. The caterpillars are black or green, with narrow lighter stripes on the back and sides. They spit out a brownish substance, spring into the air and wriggle a lot when they are disturbed. The species eats velvet beans, peanut, soybeans, cotton, kudzu, alfalfa, cowpeas, horse beans, snap beans, lima beans, and coffeeweeds. Its common name is velvetbean caterpillar and velvetbean moth.
Egg viability was highest at 25 °C (77 °F) and adaptation to higher temperatures did not occur over a three generation observation. This suggests global warming will reduce A. gemmatalis losses on soybeans in tropical areas that are already at 25 °C (77 °F) but increase predation on soybeans in areas currently below that temperature, thus in fact only shifting the affected area.

Atteva pustulella,species,wikipedia.org,"Atteva pustulella, also known as polilla cigarrito arlequín or little cigarette harlequin moth, is a moth of the  family Attevidae. It is found from Costa Rica, where it meets Atteva aurea, southwards to Uruguay and Argentina. It is also present in the Antilles. There are also several reports from Dominica, Jamaica, Haiti and Martinique.

The larvae feed only on new shoots of Simarouba amara. There are records for 
Ailanthus altissima in Argentina (Berg 1880), Castela erecta in Saint Croix, Antilles (Walsingham, 1914), Castela peninsularis, Castela polyandra and Castela emory in the United States (Powell et al. 1973), but these are doubtful records for which either the host or the moth species may be misidentified (Becker 2009).

It is thought to be a Müllerian mimic of the wasp Parachartergus apicalis, with predators paying a high penalty for mistaking M. strigosa for the wasp and there is a small reward from correctly identifying it since M. strigosa is bitter tasting and covered in scales.

Polygrammodes oxydalis,species,wikipedia.org,"Polygrammodes oxydalis is a moth in the family Crambidae. It was described by Achille Guenée in 1854. It is found in the southern United States, where it has been recorded from Georgia, Florida and southern Texas. It has also been reported from Costa Rica. Adults have been recorded on wing from May to October. The larvae feed on the roots of Vernonia species.


== Habitat and Distribution ==
Polygrammodes oxydalis is predominantly found in the southern regions of the United States, particularly in states such as Georgia, Florida, and Texas. Its range extends to Central America, with confirmed sightings in Costa Rica. The moth inhabits environments where its larval host plants, particularly those in the Vernonia genus (often referred to as ironweeds), thrive. These plants typically grow in disturbed areas, open fields, and along roadsides, providing ample feeding opportunities for the larvae. The adult moths are most active during the warmer months, generally from May to October, coinciding with the blooming periods of their host plants. This timing is crucial for ensuring that larvae have adequate food sources upon hatching.
Morphological Characteristics
The adult moths exhibit a wingspan of approximately 25 to 30 mm. The forewings are characterized by a distinctive pattern that includes shades of brown and yellow, often with darker markings. The hindwings are lighter, typically featuring a whitish color that enhances their visibility during flight. The physical appearance of P. oxydalis not only aids in camouflage against predators but also plays a role in mate selection and species recognition, critical for reproductive success in moths.
Life Cycle and Behavior
The life cycle of Polygrammodes oxydalis begins with the female laying eggs on or near the roots of Vernonia plants. After hatching, the larvae (caterpillars) burrow into the soil to feed on the plant's roots. This feeding behavior is crucial for their development and can sometimes lead to noticeable damage to the host plants. The larvae undergo several instar stages, culminating in pupation. The pupae are typically formed in the soil, where they undergo metamorphosis into adult moths. This underground lifestyle offers some protection from predators and environmental stresses. Adults are nocturnal and exhibit typical moth behaviors, such as attraction to light sources during the night. Their activity patterns align with the availability of food sources and mating opportunities.
Ecological Role
Polygrammodes oxydalis plays a vital role in its ecosystem as both a pollinator and a prey species. Adult moths are known to visit flowers while seeking nectar, contributing to the pollination of various plants, including their host plants.As larvae, they contribute to the breakdown of organic matter in the soil, which aids in nutrient cycling.  Their feeding habits can impact plant health, potentially influencing the distribution and abundance of Vernonia and related species. They serve as a food source for various predators, including birds, other insects, and small mammals, thereby playing an integral part in the food web.

Psamatodes abydata,species,wikipedia.org,"Macaria abydata, commonly known as the dot-lined angle, is a moth of the  family Geometridae. It is native from northern Argentina to the Caribbean and southern United States (southern states from Arizona to Florida, regularly wandering north to Colorado, Kentucky and other more northern states). It has been introduced to the Pacific and has spread rapidly since. The first introduction occurred  in Hawaii in 1970 (recorded from all the main islands in 1984). Further spread occurred as follows:

1975: Yap, central Micronesia
1976: Bonin Islands (Chichi-jima, Haha-jima)
1977: Saipan, central Micronesia (1985)
1980: Okinawa Island
1983: Taiwan
1985: Guam, central Micronesia (1985) Sulawesi (1986)
1986: Tonga (1985), Fiji (1985), Miyako Islands (Miyako-jima), Luzon, the Philippines (1985)
1987: New Caledonia (1985), Sabah, Malaysia
1988: western Samoa (1985)
1992: Hong Kong
The wingspan is 22–27 mm (0.87–1.06 in).
The phrase ""dot-lined"" comes from the evidence of small dots along the postmedial and sometimes median line of both forewing and hindwing(anterior of the marginal band).
Recorded host plants for larvae in its natural range are Vachellia farnesiana, Cassia, Sesbania, Parkinsonia aculeata and Glycine max. Larvae have been observed on Acacia koa and introduced Lysiloma latisiliquum and Litchi chinensis in Hawaii. In the Indo-Australian tropics it has been reared from Leucaena and Mimosa diplotricha.

Homoeoprepes trochiloides,species,wikipedia.org,"Homoeoprepes trochiloides is a moth in the family Elachistidae. It was described by Thomas de Grey, 6th Baron Walsingham, in 1909. It is found in Costa Rica.
The wingspan is about 25 mm. The forewings are iridescent purplish, or bluish, grey, smeared with dark ferruginous, which becomes rich chestnut-brown in some lights, especially towards the apex. This dark shading commences at the base of the costa, where it forms an elongate patch of diffused scaling, scarcely separated from a large median blotch commencing near the middle of the base, following the cell almost to its outer extremity and diffused upward to the costa and downward into the middle of the fold. There is a patch of partly raised chestnut scales on the cell at one-third from the base, as well as a few similar scales in the fold somewhat beyond it, and, at the outer extremity of the cell a strong patch of raised dull golden scales, mixed with fuscous, whence a rich chestnut streak is produced to the apex, somewhat dilated upward to the costa above it. The hindwings are pale cupreous.

Paectes nana,species,wikipedia.org,"Paectes nana is a moth in the family Euteliidae. It is widespread from Florida through the Greater Antilles (except for Puerto Rico) and from Mexico to Costa Rica. In South America, it is found in Venezuela, Colombia and northern Ecuador. It has been introduced to the Galapagos Islands.
The forewing length is 10.9–11.6 mm for males and 9.4–9.9 mm for females. Adults are sexually dimorphic. There are two distinct forms. The most easily recognized bears exaggerated dark markings on the apical portion of the postmedial line that is contiguous with the subapical dash. The other form most resembles both Paectes asper, but in Paectes nana, the forewing costa is gray with small, faint, dark-gray quadrate spots along the margin. Adults are probably on wing year round with recorded dates from January to March, June to July, September to October and December.
The larvae have been reared from Schinus terebinthifolius. Other records include Bursera simaruba and Bursera tomentosa.
The moth was originally named Paectes isabel after the artist Isabel Cooper (artist).

It is native to South America, where it is found from Colombia, Venezuela and the Guianas, throughout the Amazon basin in Brazil and Peru. It has also been recorded as an introduced species in Hawaii.
The length of the forewings is 64–80 mm.
The larvae feed on Saccharum officinarum, Musa, Heliconia and Ichnosiphon species. It is considered a pest species. Young larvae make a small cavity and then tunnel into the heart of the cane of the host plant. They tunnel upwards and downwards, and create a shelter in the rootstock where they rest. Pupation takes place in the rootstock or at the base of the cane.

Cydia deshaisiana,species,wikipedia.org,"Cydia saltitans or jumping bean moth is a moth from Mexico that is most widely known as its larva, where it inhabits the carpels of seeds from several related shrubby trees, mainly Sebastiania pavoniana or  Sapium biloculare (syn. Pleradenophora bilocularis). These seeds are commonly known as Mexican jumping beans.
The moth lays the egg on the young capsule. The hatched larva gnaws into the fruit, which closes the minute hole during its growth. The larva attaches itself to the capsule with many silken threads by hooks on its anal and four hind abdominal prolegs. When the fruit is warmed, for instance by being held in the palm of the hand, the larva twitches, pulling on the threads and causing the characteristic hop. ""Jump"" is often an exaggeration, but the beans nonetheless do move around quite a bit.
The larva may live for months inside the fruit with periods of inactivity.  It eats away the seed inside the capsule, making a hollow for itself. If the fruit is cut, the larva will repair the hole with silk.
If the larva has suitable conditions such as moisture, it will live long enough to go into a pupal stage.
In preparation for this, it eats a circular hole through the shell and closes it again with a silken plug. This is to enable the jawless adult moth to escape from the fruit. After completion of the exit hole, it spins a cocoon within the fruit, with a passageway leading to the opening. During the following pupal stage, the larva will not move any more.
Normally in the spring, the moth will force its way out of what remains of the fruit, through the round ""trapdoor"", leaving behind the pupal casing.
The small, jawless silver and gray-colored moth will live for only a few days.


== Nomenclature ==
In most of the historical literature prior to 2020, the name of this species is given as deshaisiana and attributed to Lucas, 1858. However, careful examination of the source literature revealed that Lucas' name has never been available (a nomen nudum under the ICZN rules), and also that Westwood's original name, Carpocapsa saltitans, had evidently been introduced earlier in that same year (Westwood's first appeared in July 1858 and Lucas' in November). Westwood coined the name using elements referring to the behavior; carpo and capsa indicating that it lives within a seed (see podocarp), and saltitans referring to its jumping behavior.

They feed inside the seed pods of shrubs of the genusSebastiania, and are found mainly in Mexico. In late summer, the seed pods fall to the ground and split into three sections. The larva, when warmed, will twitch, causing the fragment of seed pod to jump with it. This behaviour has made these ""Mexican jumping beans"" a novelty item which are collected and exported.It is thought that the behaviour is a mechanism to help the developing larva escape the hot sun and find a sheltered or shady situation.The adult moth is a fairly typicalCydia, with a combination of grey and silvery markings.In Britain, a small number of the adults have been caught, having emerged from imported beans.",833

Diaphania nitidalis,species,wikipedia.org,"Diaphania nitidalis, the pickleworm, is a serious agricultural pest insect in the family Crambidae. It damages squash primarily, but it is also a common pest of other cucurbits such as cucumbers and melons. It is a tropical species which can be found in the southern United States. In the southern United States, earlier plants are less affected compared to later plantings. It does not tolerate cold temperatures. The species was first described by Caspar Stoll in 1781. 
The pickleworm adult is a flashy moth with wide triangular wings and a wingspan of about one inch. The wings are mostly iridescent brown with a central band of yellow and thin white borders. The legs are white. The abdomen is mostly brown except for the tail segment, which is white and has a large fluffy tuft. Adults are not active during daylight hours and eggs are laid only at night. It lays tiny eggs in small clusters on growing areas of the plant, such as flowers, shoots, and new leaf buds. These areas are the feeding spots for the larvae, which emerge after a few days and eat voraciously for two weeks. The younger larvae are thin white caterpillars with numerous small black spots. As the larvae mature they become plump and darker in color and they lose their spots. The larvae tuck themselves into crumpled dead leaves to pupate for 8 to 10 days. The life cycle varies by environmental conditions ranging from 22 to 55 days.  In warm areas the pickleworm can produce four generations per year.


== Infestation and impacts ==
Pickleworm damage on cucurbit crops is evidenced by the lack of flowers and new leaves and shoots, as these are the first parts of the plant to be consumed. The larvae also eat the fruit, burrowing down into the flesh and leaving a hole marked with a pile of white frass.
Squash varieties that showed some resistance to pickleworms include the varieties butternut, Golden Hubbard, and Improved Green Hubbard.  Summer squash varieties tend to be susceptible to pickleworm damage.
