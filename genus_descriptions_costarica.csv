Adela,genus,artfakta.se,"Arterna i släktet Adela förekommer främst i Palearktis men även i Afrika och Nordamerika. I Europa finns 12 arter och i Norden fyra. I världen finns troligen omkring 100 arter i släktet, men antalet är högst osäkert eftersom många av de beskrivna arterna sannolikt är synonymer eller tillhör andra släkten av antennmalar. Fjärilarna är medelstora och har metallglänsande framvingar, oftast utan distinkt teckning. Hanens antenn är mer än dubbelt så lång som framvingen medan honans antenn är 1–1,5 gånger så lång som framvingen. Liksom hos arterna i Nemophora har hanen förstorade ögon. Den tydligaste skillnaden jämfört med Nemophora är att arterna i släktet Adela har unika, utåtriktade, krokformiga taggar på antennsegmenten 8, 9 och/eller 10. Omedelbart efter att ägget kläckts tillverkar larven en hylsa som byts ut mot en större allt eftersom larven tillväxer.",866

Vipsania,genus,wikipedia.org,"Vipsania Agrippina (; unknown – 20 AD) was the first wife of the Emperor Tiberius. She was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Attica, thus being a granddaughter of Titus Pomponius Atticus, the best friend of Cicero.


== Biography ==
She was betrothed by Augustus and her father to Tiberius, the stepson of Augustus, before her first birthday. They were married around 19 BC. Their son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was born in 14 BC.
Despite Vipsania and Tiberius enjoying a happy marriage, Augustus ordered the two to divorce after the death of Vipsania's father, who was married to Augustus's daughter Julia the Elder. Even though Tiberius wished to remain with Vipsania and held disdain for Julia for her purported unfaithfulness, Augustus engaged him to Julia in order to link Tiberius's growing power to the Julian family. At the time of their divorce, Vipsania was pregnant with a second child, who did not survive.
Tiberius divorced Vipsania against his will in 11 BC (non sine magno angore animi [""not without great mental anguish""], according to Suetonius) and never ceased to rue his action. On one occasion Tiberius caught sight of Vipsania and followed her with an intent and tearful gaze. Precautions were taken to avoid further embarrassing meetings with her.
In 11 BC she married Gaius Asinius Gallus, a Senator and son of the famous orator Gaius Asinius Pollio. They had at least six sons and maybe one or more daughters. Vipsania Agrippina died in AD 20, a few days after the ovation of her son Drusus, which took place on 28 May.
Tiberius hated Gallus, not least because Gallus claimed that Drusus was his own son. In 30, at Tiberius' instigation, the Senate was to declare Gallus a public enemy. He died in prison in 33, of starvation.


== Issue ==
Vipsania and Gallus' known sons were:

Gaius Asinius Pollio – Consul in 23; exiled as an accuser of a conspiracy and later was put to death on orders from Empress Valeria Messalina.
Marcus Asinius Agrippa – Consul in 25 and died in the end of 26. Tacitus describes him as ""not unworthy of his ancestors"". His son Marcus Asinius Marcellus was Consul in 54, at the time when the Emperor Claudius died.
Asinius Saloninus (possibly Gnaeus Asinius Saloninus, sometimes wrongly called Salonius) – died in 22. Tacitus describes him as an ‘eminent’ person. Saloninus was intended to marry one of the granddaughters of Emperor Tiberius.
Servius Asinius Celer – was consul suffectus in 38. From Emperor Caligula he purchased a fish at an enormous price. He is mentioned in the satire, by Seneca, The Pumpkinification of Claudius, where he is listed among the many people killed by that emperor; his death probably occurred sometime before mid-47. Asinius Celer seems to have had a daughter by the name of Asinia Agrippina, though her existence is obscure.
Asinius Gallus (possibly Lucius Asinius Gallus, sometimes wrongly called Gallo) – in 46 he conspired against Claudius and was forced to go into exile. Cassius Dio describes him as being ""very small and ugly"". Later rehabilitated, he became Consul in 62.
Gnaeus Asinius – his existence is recorded by the townsfolk of Puteoli, whose patron he was. Nothing else is known about him. It has been proposed that he have been identical with Asinius Saloninus or the foregoing Asinius Gallus but since Asinius Gallus seems to have been Lucius Asinius Gallus who became a Consul in 60, by exclusion of parts Gnaeus Asinius may be the Asinius Saloninus.
Besides their sons Vipsania and Gallus likely had at least one daughter, but possibly more. Pomponia Graecina was a distinguished lady married to Aulus Plautius, and appears to have been a daughter of a daughter of Vipsania. Plautius was a general in the conquest of Britain, which he received as a military ovation. Nero murdered their son, reportedly because Agrippina the Younger, mother of Nero, was in love with him and encouraged him to bid for the throne.
Tacitus states that Vipsania was the only one of Agrippa's children to die a natural death. She was one of the leading women of her time; and between 21 and 23, her son Drusus honored her memory with statues, coins and inscriptions.


== Cultural depictions ==
Robert Graves' novel I, Claudius mentions Tiberius following Vipsania with his eyes after their divorce, referencing Suetonius (Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Tiberius, 7).
The television adaptation went somewhat further, the second episode included a fairly lengthy scene between Tiberius and Vipsania on the eve of her second marriage, with Tiberius upset and regretting their divorce. She was played by Sheila Ruskin.
Deadline announced in December 2022 that Vipsania would be depicted once more on television screens as part of Sky and MGM+’s second season of Domina, played by actress Joelle.

Sarsina,genus,wikipedia.org,"Sarsina  (Romagnol: Sêrsna) is an Italian town situated in the  province of Forlì-Cesena, Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. Its territory is included in the Tuscan-Romagnolo Apennines.


== History ==
Ancient Sarsina or Sassina was a town of the Umbri. In 266 BC Roman consuls celebrated a triumph over the Sassinates.  It is mentioned in the Fasti, and in the enumeration of the Italian allies of the Romans in 225 BCE the Umbri and Sassinates are mentioned, on an equal footing, as providing 20,000 men between them. It is possible that the tribus Sapinia (the name of which is derived from the river Sapis) mentioned by Livy in the account of the Roman marches against the Boii in 201 BC and 196 BC formed a part of the Sassinates.
The playwright Plautus was native of Sassina. The town had a strategic importance, as inscriptions,  preserved in the local museum, show. Its milk is frequently mentioned; it was the centre of a pasture district and it provided a number of recruits for the Praetorian Guard. 
In the 10th century the bishops obtained the temporal sovereignty of the city and the surrounding district, which thus became a prince-bishopric. From 1327 until 1400 it was disputed for by the Ordelaffi of Forlì, the popes and the bishops. In the fifteenth century it was subject in turn to the Malatesta family of Cesena, and then to the Malatesta branch of Rimini, from whom it was taken by Cesare Borgia (1500–03), on whose death it was captured by the Venetians (1503–09).
In 1518 it was enfeoffed to the Pio di Meldola, passing later to the Aldobrandini.


== Main sights ==
The city contains remains of several ancient buildings, one of which probably was the public baths. Furthermore, remains of temples and fortifications have been found, as well as a number of urns, pillars, bronze objects, etc.
The Sarsina cathedral was probably constructed around the years 1000–08, has been chosen as its official year of construction, so that there were festivities in 2008.
Ennio Morricone on 25 August 2008 conducted his newest composition Vuoto d'anima piena, a work for vocals, an orchestra of 40 and a choir of 60 persons, in the cathedral-basilica for the first time. The text is based on texts by the Persian mystic Rumi.
The adjacent Sanctuary of San Vicinio (Saint Vicinius)  is a place of veneration.


== Economy ==
Besides agriculture and cattle breeding, the principal employments of the population are the sulphur and manganese industries. There are some charcoal deposits and sulphur springs.

 Lezoux, France

Orgyia,genus,artfakta.se,"Detta släkte består av ganska små arter där honorna delvis saknar vingar (flera tropiska arter) eller helt saknar funktionella vingar och bara har mycket korta vinglappar (alla arter i tempererade områden). Hos åtminstone en art, ljungtofsspinnare Orgyia antiquoides, tillbringar honan hela sitt liv i kokongen och kryper inte ut ur den ens inför parningen. Hanarna är hos många arter tecknade i brunt, men det finns också arter med gula och svartaktiga färger. Flertalet arter är aktiva på dagen i solsken och flyger i en ganska snabb, kastande flykt, hos några i en mycket snabb flykt. Genitalierna hos hanarna har en lång stavlik uncus, och de ganska långa genitalklaffarna är hos de flesta arterna djupt delade med varje del lika lång. Larverna är tecknade i vackra färger och har fyra täta hårpenslar på ryggen och ett par framåtsträckta penslar och en längre, bakåtriktad pensel. Släktet förekommer i Gamla världen, både i nordliga områden och i de tropiska delarna av Indoaustralien och söderut till Australien, och dessutom Nordamerika. Totalt innehåller det åtminstone 30 arter varav ungefär 10 förekommer i Nordamerika. I Palearktis förekommer knappt 15 arter och i Europa åtta.",1188

Menevia,genus,wikipedia.org,"The Diocese of Menevia (Latin: Dioecesis Menevensis) was a Latin Church diocese of the Catholic Church in Wales. It was one of two suffragan dioceses in the ecclesiastical province of Cardiff and was subject to the Archdiocese of Cardiff, until it merged with the archdiocese in 2024, to form the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff-Menevia.


== History ==

The history of the diocese of St Davids is traditionally traced to that saint (Dewi) in the latter half of the 6th century. Records of the history of the diocese before Norman times are very fragmentary, however, consisting of a few chance references in old chronicles, such as Annales Cambriae and Brut y Tywysogion (Rolls Series).
On 12 May 1898, the Apostolic Vicariate of Wales was elevated to diocesan status and had its seat at the Cathedral Church of Our Lady of Sorrows in Wrexham  until 1987 when the Diocese of Wrexham was created.The Diocese of Menevia covered between 1987 and 2024 the area roughly that of the ancient Diocese of St Davids. (""Menevia"" was the Roman name for St Davids.) The Catholic diocese was led by Mark O'Toole, Archbishop of Cardiff, when Cardiff and Menevia merged in a single Archdiocese in 2024.
The sixth century bishop St Ismael is honoured on 16 June.

Lambana,genus,wikipedia.org,"Anito, also spelled anitu,  refers to carved humanoid figures made of wood, stone, or ivory, that represent ancestral spirits worshiped as protective household deities. it also refers to ancestor spirits, evil spirits. The diwata are the nature spirits and deities in the Indigenous Philippine folk religions from the precolonial age to the present, although the term itself may have other meanings and associations depending on the Filipino ethnic group. Diwata also means fairy or nymph in modern Filipino language
Anito (a term predominantly used in Northern Luzon) is also sometimes known as diwata in certain ethnic groups (especially among Visayans).
Pag-anito is séance, a ritual where a shaman (called babaylan in Visayan or katalonan in Tagalog) serves as a medium to talk to dead ancestors and spirits of the dead. This ceremony is often part of a celebration or other rituals. If the ritual involves a nature spirit or deity, it is called Pag-diwata, which includes worship or offering sacrifices to deities and spirits.

The belief in anito are sometimes referred to as Anitism in scholarly literature (Spanish: anitismo or anitería) literally means veneration of the spirits of the dead. The word anitism or ancestor worship  from the Hispano-Filipino form anitismo, though not in current usage, it was a precolonial Tagalog belief system, a continual invocation and adoration of the anitos, the souls or spirits of their ancestors. From its original meaning of ""ancestral spirit"".
The ancient Tagalogs believed in anitos, the spirits or souls of their ancestors. They honored and worshipped them in daily life especially the spirits of parents and grandparents who had passed away. These ancestor spirits were often represented by small idols kept in homes, sometimes made from gold and shaped like animals, such as crocodiles. Anitos weren't only from the home. Some were believed to live in mountains, forests, and rice fields. These were often the souls of ancient warriors or previous inhabitants of the land. The Tagalogs believed that these spirits could protect or harm, so they treated them with respect. Unlike other nearby cultures that worshipped many gods and spirits without making idols, the Tagalogs made physical representations only for certain anitos mainly those connected to the household. Different regions and tribes had their own names for these spirits. While Tagalogs called them anito, others used names like nitu, aitu, or hantu. This shows how widespread and deeply rooted the belief in ancestor spirits was across Southeast Asia.


== Etymology ==
Anito is from Proto-Austronesian *qaNiCu ""ghost, owl"", thus cognate with Malay hantu. While Diwata is borrowed from Sanskrit देवता (devátā), possibly via Malay dewata.


== Spirits ==
Pre-colonial Filipinos were animistic. They believed that everything has a spirit, from rocks and trees to animals and humans to natural phenomena. These spirits are collectively known as diwa meaning meaning; spirit or essence and the souls of the dead are called anito, derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qanitu and Proto-Austronesian *qaNiCu (""spirit of the dead""). Cognates in other Austronesian cultures include the Micronesian aniti, Malaysian and Indonesian hantu or antu, Nage nitu, and Polynesian atua and aitu. As well as Tao anito, Taivoan alid, Seediq and Atayal utux, Bunun hanitu or hanidu, and Tsou hicu among Taiwanese aborigines. Anito can be divided into two main categories: the ancestor spirits (ninunò), and deities and nature spirits (diwata).


=== Anito Ancestor spirits ===

The ninunò (lit. 'ancestor') can be the spirits of actual ancestors, cultural heroes, or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Pre-colonial Filipinos believed that upon death, the ""free"" soul (Visayan: kalag; Tagalog: kaluluwa) of a person travels to a spirit world, usually by voyaging across an ocean on a boat (a bangka or baloto).

There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups. Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or the conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of Christianity and Islam; rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an otherworld that exists alongside the material world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the spirit world and lead normal lives in the spirit world as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually reincarnate after a period of time in the spirit world.
In some cultures (like among the Kalinga people), the acceptance of a soul by ancestors into a certain realm in the spirit world requires tattoos (batok), by which they can gauge the worthiness of a soul. In other cultures, tattoos illuminate and guide the spirits during the journey to the afterlife.
Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. Pag-anito may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession (kalara or kalda), or advice. Ancestor spirits that become intercessors with deities are known as pintakasi or pitulon. Vengeful spirits of the dead can manifest as apparitions or ghosts (mantiw) and cause harm to living people. Pag-anito can be used to appease or banish them. Ancestor spirits also figured prominently during illness or death, as they were believed to be the ones who call the soul to the spirit world, guide the soul (a psychopomp), or meet the soul upon arrival.
Ancestor spirits are also known as kalading among the Igorot; tonong among the Maguindanao and Maranao; umboh among the Sama-Bajau; nunò or umalagad among Tagalogs and Visayans; nonò among Bicolanos; umagad or umayad among the Manobo; and tiladmanin among the Tagbanwa.


=== Diwata Nature spirits and deities ===

Diwatas In Philippine mythology refers to fairies, nature spirits, celestial beings, and mythological gods. In folk religion, it specifically refers to celestial beings and nature spirits that were never human. These spirits can range from guardians of objects, plants, or animals to deities representing natural forces, abstract concepts, or even gods in a pantheon. Pag-Diwata is a ritual giving praise, veneration and worship to the gods and nature spirits.
The modern Filipino understanding of diwata encompasses meanings such as fairy, muse, nymph, dryad, or even deity (god or goddess). The word is thought to originate from the Sanskrit word devata (deity). Diwatas in folklore and mythology are often associated and or synchronized with fairies called lambana. In modern Tagalog, diwata means fairy or nymph. It refers particularly to nature spirits of extraordinary beauty, like Maria Makiling. Spirits that have never been human are differentiated in some ethnic groups as diwata. These spirits can range from simple spirits like the diwata of a particular inanimate object, plant, animal, or place, to deities who personify abstract concepts and natural phenomena,  to deities who are part of an actual pantheon. They are also known as dewatu, divata, duwata, ruwata, dewa, dwata, diya, etc., in various Philippine languages (including Tagalog diwa, ""spirit"" or ""essence""); all of which are derived from Sanskrit devata (देवता) or devá (देव), meaning ""deity"". These names are the result of syncretization with Hindu-Buddhist beliefs due to the indirect cultural exchange (via Srivijaya and Majapahit) between the Philippines and South Asia.
However, what entities are considered diwata varies by ethnic group. In some ethnic groups like the B'laan, Cuyonon Visayans, and the Tagalog, Diwata refers to the supreme being in their pantheon, in which case there are different terms for non-human spirits. Like in ancestor spirits, diwata are referred to in polite kinship titles when addressed directly, like apo (""elder"") or nuno (""grandparent"").
There are three general types of non-human spirits. The first are the environmental or nature spirits ""bound"" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to genii loci). They ""own"" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also ""keepers"" or totems of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.
The second type of spirits are the ""unbound"" spirits which have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms, have gender differentiation, and have personal names. They are most similar to the elves and fairies of European folklore. These are the most common types of spirits to become abyan (spirit guides of babaylan), as they are the most ""sociable"" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as engkanto (from Spanish encanto) in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the ""bound"" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.

The last is a class of malevolent spirits or demons, as well as supernatural beings, generally collectively known as aswang, yawa, or mangalos (also mangalok, mangangalek, or magalos) among Tagalogs and Visayans. There are numerous kinds of aswang with specific abilities, behavior, or appearance. Examples include sigbin, wakwak, tiyanak, and manananggal. The first two categories of diwata can also be malevolent, what sets the third category apart is that they can not be appealed to with offerings and they are utterly pitiless. Most practices associated with them is to ward them off, banish them, or destroy them. They are never addressed nor worshiped in religious rituals.
Diwata are rarely spoken about openly for fear of attracting their attention. Instead they are referred to with euphemisms like ""those unlike us"" (Visayan: dili ingon nato) or various names, like banwaanon or taga-banwa, that translate literally to ""dweller of a place"". Among Tagalogs, non-human nature spirits are also euphemistically referred to as lamanglupa (""[dwellers of] the bowels of the earth"") or taga-dagat (""[dwellers of] the depths of the sea""), depending on their domain.
Diwata exist in both the material world and the spirit world. They can be formless or have a material body. They can also take over a body through spirit possession (Visayan: hola, hulak, tagdug, or saob; Tagalog: sanib), an ability essential for the séances in pag-anito. They are believed to be capable of shapeshifting (baliw or baylo), becoming invisible, or creating visions or illusions (anino or landung, lit. ""shadow""). Their powers, however, are limited to their particular domain. A diwata of a forest, for instance, has no dominion over the sea. Most are generally benevolent or capriciously neutral, although they can cause misfortunes and illnesses if angered, disrespected, or mistakenly encountered. Other common characteristics of diwata are that they are perceived as an invisible ""cold"" presence (in contrast to ""warm"" human spirits); that they leave no footprints (unlike human spirits); and that they sense the world and ""eat"" by means of smelling. Diwata who take human form are said to be pale-skinned and could be distinguished from humans by the absence of a philtrum on the upper lip.

Diwata are often depicted as appearing to unsuspecting people in human or animal form, sometimes causing unintentional harm. They can also deliberately play tricks on mortals, like seducing or abducting beautiful men and women into the spirit world. Certain places are believed to be owned by diwata or are borders to the spirit world. These are normally avoided or only entered with precautions, especially during twilight when diwata are believed to cross over from the spirit world into the material world. Harm or illness caused by diwata are known as buyag in Visayan and usog in Tagalog. People who were harmed by interactions with diwata are euphemistically described as having been ""greeted"" (Visayan: gibati, Tagalog: nabati) or ""played with"" (Visayan gidulaan, Tagalog: napaglaruan or nakatuwaan) by diwata.
To avoid inadvertently angering a diwata, Filipinos perform a customary pasintabi sa nuno (""respectfully apologizing or asking permission from ancestors for passing""). This is done by saying the phrases ""tao po"" (""a human [is passing], elder), ""tabi po"" or ""tabi apo"" (""by your permission, elder"") when passing by a place believed to  be inhabited by a diwata.
During the Spanish period, diwata were syncretized with elves and fairies in European mythology and folklore, and were given names like duende (goblin or dwarf), encantador or encanto (""spell [caster]""), hechicero (""sorcerer""), sirena (""mermaid""), or maligno (""evil [spirit]""). In Islamized ethnic groups of the Philippines, these nature spirits are usually called jinn or saitan, due to the influence of Islamic mythology.


== Religious objects and places ==


=== Taotao figures ===

Anito in general refers to carved humanoid figures made of wood, stone, or ivory, that represent ancestral spirits worshiped as protective household deities. 
These Ancestor spirits were usually represented by carved figures. These were known as taotao (""little human"", also taotaohan, latawo, tinatao, or  tatao), bata-bata (""little child""), ladaw (""image"" or ""likeness""; also laraw, ladawang, lagdong, or larawan), or likha (""creation""; also likhak) in most of the Philippines. Other names include bulul (also bulol or bul-ul) among the Ifugao; tinagtaggu (also tinattaggu) among the Kankanaey and Tuwali Ifugao; lablabbon among the Itneg; manaug among the Lumad; and tagno among Bicolanos.  Among Tagalogs, taotao were also sometimes referred to as lambana (""altar"" or ""sacred place""), after the location in which they are usually kept.

Taotao were usually austere roughly-carved figures made from wood, stone, or ivory. Some taoatao encountered by the Spanish were made from precious metals or ornamented with gold and jewelry, but these were very rare. Taotao were almost always depicted in the squatting position with the arms crossed over the knees, which is reminiscent of the fetal position, the everyday conversing posture, and the position bodies are arranged during death among Ancient Filipinos. Some figures, however, are depicted standing or doing everyday activities like dancing, pounding rice, or nursing infants.

Most taotao represent an actual deceased person, usually carved by the community upon their funeral. As such, there can be hundreds of taotao in a single village, some of them centuries old.

In very rare cases, diwata can be depicted as taotao in anthropomorphic form, as chimeras or legendary creatures, or as animals. These include a special class of figures called hipag among the Igorot which depict war deities, as well as kinabigat (carved houseposts) and hogang (carved tree fern posts used as boundary markers and as wards against harm). As a rule, however, diwata are not usually depicted as taotao or by any man-made representations.
Taotao were not intrinsically sacred. They were representations of the spirits, not the actual spirits themselves. They only became sacred during their use in a pag-anito ritual. Without the spirit they represent, they are treated as mundane carved pieces of wood or sculpted stone. The anonymous author of the 1572 Relación de la conquista de la isla de Luzón describes pag-anito rituals of the Tagalog people as such:

When any chief is ill, he invites his kindred and orders a great meal to be prepared, consisting of fish, meat, and wine. When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called manganito or baylán in their tongue), they put the idol called Batala and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians—neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatsoever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence.
Regardless, very old taotao handed down through generations are prized as family heirlooms. Among the Igorot, pieces of taotao may also be chipped off and boiled into a medicinal tea.
Taotao were commonly kept in corners or small shelves inside houses or granaries. Spanish missionaries recorded that taotao were present in every Filipino household, no matter how poor.
When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word ""anito"" came to be associated with these physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in pag-anito rituals. During the American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946), the meaning of the Spanish word idolo (""a thing worshiped"") was further conflated with the English word ""idol"". Thus in the modern Filipino language, anito has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved taotao figures, instead of the actual spirits themselves.


=== Shrines, altars, and sacred areas ===

Ancient Filipinos and Filipinos who continue to adhere to the Indigenous Philippine folk religions generally do not have so-called ""temples"" of worship under the context known to foreign cultures. However, they do have sacred shrines, which are also called as spirit houses. They can range in size from small roofed platforms, to structures similar to a small house (but with no walls), to shrines that look similar to pagodas, especially in the south where early mosques were also modeled in the same way. These shrines were known in various indigenous terms, which depend on the ethnic group association. They can also be used as places to store taotao and caskets of ancestors. Among Bicolanos, taotao were also kept inside sacred caves called moog.
During certain ceremonies, anito are venerated through temporary altars near sacred places. These were called latangan or lantayan in Visayan and dambana or lambana in Tagalog. These bamboo or rattan altars are identical in basic construction throughout most of the Philippines. They were either small roof-less platforms or standing poles split at the tip (similar to a tiki torch). They held halved coconut shells, metal plates, or martaban jars as receptacles for offerings. Taotao may sometimes also be placed on these platforms.
Other types of sacred places or objects of worship of diwata include the material manifestation of their realms. The most widely venerated were balete trees (also called nonok, nunuk, nonoc, etc.) and anthills or termite mounds (punso). Other examples include mountains, waterfalls, tree groves, reefs, and caves.


=== Spirit animals and plants ===

Some animals like crocodiles, snakes, monitor lizards, tokay geckos, and various birds were also venerated as servants or manifestations of diwata, or as powerful spirits themselves. These include legendary creatures like the dragon or serpent Bakunawa, the giant bird Minokawa of the Bagobo, and the colorful Sarimanok of the Maranao.
Omen birds were particularly important. The most common omen birds were doves with green or blue iridescent feathers called limokon (usually the common emerald dove, imperial pigeons, or brown doves). Other omen birds include fairy-bluebirds (tigmamanukan, balan tikis, balatiti, or bathala among Tagalogs; and batala among Kapampangans); kingfishers (salaksak among the Ilocano, Igorot, and Sambal); and flowerpeckers (pitpit, ichaw, ido, or labeg among the Igorot).
Certain animals (in addition to omen birds) are also believed to be manifestations of spirits, and there were taboos when interacting with them or speaking about them as their connections to the spirit world make them innately dangerous. This belief was universal among early Austronesian animism, existing not only in the Philippines, but also among the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, other Islander Southeast Asians, and Pacific Islanders. When spoken of, these spirit creatures are marked with a prefix, reconstructed as proto-Austronesian *qali- or *kali-, which still survive fossilized in modern languages in Austronesian cultures, though the beliefs may have long been forgotten. Only very specific creatures were regarded in this way, the most prominent being butterflies which are still widely associated with ghosts. The animals in this category include the following:

Ants, winged ants, or winged termites, e.g. Cebuano alibusbus, Pinatubo Aeta alidakdak, and Maranao kalalapa
Aphid, e.g. Bikol alusiwsiw
Bats, e.g. Teduray kelimbungan, Bikol kulapnit, and Kapampangan talibatab
Beetles, e.g. Hanunóo alutatip and Teduray kelefutey
Birds (various), examples:
Doves, e.g. Cebuano alimukun, Tagalog kalapati, and Maranao limoken
Hanging parrots, e.g. Hanunóo kalusisi and Tagalog kulasisi
Hornbills, e.g. Teduray kelimetan
Coucals, e.g. Hanunóo balikaku
Owls, e.g. Ilocano kolalabang
Roosters (especially colorful fighting cocks), e.g. Tagalog alimbuyugin and Cebuano balakiki
Swiftlets, e.g. Ilocano kalapini, Tausug kalasiyaw and Ivatan alpasayaw
Woodpeckers, e.g. Cebuano balalatuk and Isneg kalittaxa
Bumblebees, e.g. Hanunóo alibúyug, Ilocano alimbubúyog, and Itawis arabiyóngen
Butterflies and large moths, e.g. Cebuano alibangbáng,  Ilocano kulibangbang, Ivatan kulivaavang, and Tagalog aliparó
Caterpillars, e.g. Ilocano alimbobódo, Bikol alaláso
Centipedes, e.g. Cebuano aluhipan and Ivatan alipuan
Crabs, e.g. Tagalog alimango, Cebuano alimasag, and Ilocano arimbukéng
Dragonflies, e.g. Kankanaey alallaóngan, Cebuano alindanaw, and Ilocano alimbubungáw
Earthworms, e.g. Bikol aluluntí, Hanunóo alukáti, and Pangasinan alombáyar
Fireflies, e.g. Cebuano aniníput, Tagalog alitáptap, and Ilocano kulalantí
Fish (various), examples:
Spadefish, e.g. Casiguran Dumagat Agta kalibongbong
Sailfin catfish, e.g. Cebuano alimusan
Sillago, e.g. Cebuano alasuus
Fleas, e.g. Ibanag aliffúngo and Kankanaey atilalagá
Gecko, e.g. Ilocano alutíit and Kapampangan lupísak
Grasshoppers, e.g. Cebuano alisiwsiw, Sangir kalimbotong, and Maranao karakeban
Honeybees, e.g. Cebuano ligwán, Hanunóo alibúbug, and Kapampangan anig-guan
Leeches
Land leech, e.g. Cebuano alimátuk, Tagalog limátik, and Ilocano alimátek
Paddy (aquatic) leeches, e.g. Ilocano alintá, Tagalog lintá, and Isneg alimtá
Snakes, e.g. Tagalog alimuranin, Bikol alibusógon, Ilocano alindáyag, and Isneg arimarán
Mollusks
Limpets, e.g. Cebuano alipadnu
Windowpane oyster, e.g. Ilocano kulintipay
Spiders, e.g. Aklanon talimbabága, Isinai alingakáwa, Sangir kalibangkang, and Sarangani Blaan kalmamo
Wasps, e.g. Ilocano alumpinig and Cebuano lampining
The category also includes numerous plants, many of which are or were used in shamanic or medicinal applications, including Lepisanthes rubiginosa (Tagalog kalimayo), Ticanto crista (Tagalog kalumbibit), Tabernaemontana pandacaqui (Aklanon alibutbut), Excoecaria agallocha (Aklanon alipata), Musa acuminata (Tagalog alinsanay), Diospyros pilosanthera (Tagalog alintataw), Basella rubra (Tagalog alugbati), and nettles (Hanunóo alingatngat and Isneg alalatang), among many others.
The prefix also extended to terms for actual spirits, like Tagalog kaluluwa (""soul""), Isneg Kalapataw (a totemic spirit of birds), Kankanaey aladunáxan (a spirit who makes babies cry at night to disturb their parents' sleep), and Maranao alimekat (a water spirit); as well as natural phenomena and other concepts believed to have direct ties to the spirit world, like echoes (e.g. Tagalog alingawngaw), whirlpools or tornadoes (e.g. Tagalog alimpuyó and Bikol alipúros), storms (e.g. Kankanaey alimbudádbud), shadows (e.g. Kankanaey alalangaw), [clouds of] dust (e.g. Tagalog alikabok and Western Bukidnon Manobo eliyavuk), sun or moon halos (e.g. Isneg alibongbóng), unease or restlessness (e.g. Tagalog alisuwag), rustling of the grass or wind (e.g. Ilocano aringgunay and Kankanaey alikadong), hair whorls (e.g. Cebuano alimpulu and Hanunóo aripudwan), mountain summits (e.g. Bikol alituktok and Aklanon alipungto), dizziness or fainting (e.g. Cebuano alipulung, Pangasinan alimoreng, and Kankanaey alitengteng), confusion or forgetting (e.g. Kapampangan kalingwan and Bikol aliwalas), thick smoke or steam (e.g. Ilocano alingasaw and Tagalog alimuóm), loud [annoying] noises (e.g. Cebuano alingasaw and Ifugao alidogdog), the pupil of the eye (e.g. Tagalog alikmata and Hiligaynon kalimutaw), and so on.


== Rituals and shamans ==

Anitism was not a religion about worship. Aside from good ancestor spirits and the few benevolent diwata, most anito were feared, not venerated. To an ordinary person, diwata were regarded as dangerous beings to be avoided or appeased. When interaction was necessary, they performed a ritual known as pag-anito (also mag-anito or anitohan). These are usually directed at ancestor spirits. When the pag-anito ceremony is for a diwata, the ritual is known as pagdiwata (also magdiwata or diwatahan).
Minor pag-anito rituals like praying for better weather or banishing minor ill luck can be performed by any householder. However, major pag-anito rituals required the services of the community shaman (Visayan babaylan or baylan; Tagalog katalonan or manganito).
These shamans were believed to have been ""chosen"" by a specific diwata who become their spirit guides. This was presumed to happen after they pass the initiation rites of an older shaman they were apprenticed to (usually a relative). In some cases, some shamans acquire their status after they recover from a serious illness or a bout of insanity. In most Filipino ethnic groups, shamans were almost always female. The few males who gain shaman status were usually asog or bayok, feminized men.

Major pag-anito rituals are centered around a séance. Because of their special relationship with their companion spirits, shamans can act as mediums for other anito, allowing spirits to temporarily possess their bodies. This possession happens after the shaman goes into a trance-like state. This allows the spirit to communicate verbally with the participants as well as physically act out events in the spirit world. At the moment of possession, shamans display a change in behavior and voice. They can sometimes go into seizures and become violent enough that restraints are required. The ritual ends when the spirit leaves and the shaman is awakened.
Spirits were invited into the ritual through offerings and sacrifices during and after the ceremonies. These depended on what spirit was being summoned, but offerings are usually a small portion of the harvests, cooked food, wine, gold ornaments, and betel nut. Blood from an animal was also usually part of the offerings, poured directly on the taotao or in a bowl before them. These commonly come from chickens or pigs, but can also be from carabaos or dogs. Salt and spices are usually avoided, as they are believed to be distasteful to anito. There is no record of human sacrifices being offered to anito during the Spanish period of the Philippines, except among the Bagobo people in southern Mindanao where it was prevalent until the early 20th century.
Another common pag-anito ritual throughout most of the Philippine ethnic groups involves the use of spirit boats. These were usually miniature boats laden with offerings set adrift from riverbanks and shorelines.
Pag-anito can be conducted on its own or in conjunction with other rituals and celebrations. They can be personal or family rituals or seasonal community events. They can vary considerably between different ethnic groups. The most common pag-anito were entreaties for bountiful harvests, cures for illnesses, victory in battle, prayers for the dead, or blessings.
Different ethnic groups had different diwata pantheons and rituals associated with them, though sometimes deities are shared in neighboring ethnic groups. Moreover, different communities also each have their own local patron diwata.


== Historical accounts ==
Historical accounts of anito in Spanish records include the following:

""Most of the Indians are heathens...They believe in their ancestors, and when about to embark upon some enterprise commend themselves to these, asking them for aid."" – Francisco de Sande, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (1576)
""Which treats of the rites and ceremonies observed by the Moros in the vicinity of Manilla, and of their social conditions. The god Batala. According to the religion formerly observed by these Moros, they worshiped a deity called among them Batala, which properly means ""God."" They said that they adored this Batala because he was the Lord of all, and had created human beings and villages. They said that this Batala had many agents under him, whom he sent to this world to produce, in behalf of men, what is yielded here. These beings were called anitos, and each anito had a special office. Some of them were for the fields, and some for those who journey by sea; some for those who went to war, and some for diseases. Each anito was therefore named for his office; there was, for instance, the anito of the fields, and the anito of the rain. To these anitos the people offered sacrifices, when they desired anything—to each one according to his office. The mode of sacrifice was like that of the Pintados. They summoned a catalonan, which is the same as the vaylan among the Pintados, that is, a priest. He offered the sacrifice, requesting from the anito whatever the people desired him to ask, and heaping up great quantities of rice, meat, and fish. His invocations lasted until the demon entered his body, when the catalonan fell into a swoon, foaming at the mouth. The Indians sang, drank, and feasted until the catalonan came to himself, and told them the answer that the anito had given to him. If the sacrifice was in behalf of a sick person, they offered many golden chains and ornaments, saying that they were paying a ransom for the sick person's health. This invocation of the anito continued as long as the sickness lasted.""
""When the natives were asked why the sacrifices were offered to the anito, and not to the Batala, they answered that the Batala was a great lord, and no one could speak to him. He lived in the sky; but the anito, who was of such a nature that he came down here to talk with men, was to the Batala as a minister, and interceded for them. In some places and especially in the mountain districts, when the father, mother, or other relative dies, the people unite in making a small wooden idol, and preserve it. Accordingly there is a house which contains one hundred or two hundred of these idols. These images also are called anitos; for they say that when people die, they go to serve the Batala. Therefore they make sacrifices to these anitos, offering them food, wine, and gold ornaments; and request them to be intercessors for them before the Batala, whom they regard as God."" – Miguel de Loarca, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (1582)

""They held the cayman in the utmost veneration; and, whenever they made any statement about it, when they descried it in the water, they called it Nono, which means ""grandfather."" They softly and tenderly besought it not to harm them; and to this end offered it a part of what they carried in their boats, casting the offering into the water. There was no old tree to which they did not attribute divinity; and it was a sacrilege to cut such a tree for any purpose. What more did they adore? the very stones, cliffs, and reefs, and the headlands of the shores of the sea or the rivers; and they made some offering when they passed by these, going to the stone or rock, and placing the offering upon it. I saw many times in the river of Manila a rock which for many years was an idol of that wretched people... While sailing along the island of Panai I beheld on the promontory called Nasso, near Potol, plates and other pieces of earthenware, laid upon a rock, the offering of voyagers. In the island of Mindanao between La Canela and the river [i.e., Rio Grande], a great promontory projects from a rugged and steep coast; always at these points there is a heavy sea, making it both difficult and dangerous to double them. When passing by this headland, the natives, as it was so steep, offered their arrows, discharging them with such force that they penetrated the rock itself. This they did as a sacrifice, that a safe passage might be accorded them."" – Fr. Pedro Chirino, Relacion de las Islas Filipinas (1604)
""They also adored private idols, which each one inherited from his ancestors. The Visayans called them divata, and the Tagálogs anito. Of those idols some had jurisdiction over the mountains and open country, and permission was asked from them to go thither. Others had jurisdiction over the sowed fields, and the fields were commended to them so that they might prove fruitful; and besides the sacrifices they placed articles of food in the fields for the anitos to eat, in order to place them under greater obligations. There was an anito of the sea, to whom they commended their fisheries and navigations; an anito of the house, whose favor they implored whenever an infant was born, and when it was suckled and the breast offered to it. They placed their ancestors, the invocation of whom was the first thing in all their work and dangers, among these anitos. In memory of their ancestors they kept certain very small and very badly made idols of stone, wood, gold, or ivory, called licha or laravan. Among their gods they reckoned also all those who perished by the sword, or who were devoured by crocodiles, as well as those killed by lightning. They thought that the souls of such immediately ascended to the blest abode by means of the rainbow, called by them balañgao. Generally, whoever could succeed in it attributed divinity to his aged father at his death. The aged themselves died in that presumptuous delusion, and during their sickness and at their death guided all their actions with what they imagined a divine gravity and manner. Consequently, they chose as the place for their grave some assigned spot, like one old man who lived on the seacoast between Dulac and Abuyog, which is in the island of Leyte. He ordered himself placed there in his coffin (as was done) in a house standing alone and distant from the settlement, in order that he might be recognized as a god of navigators, who were to commend themselves to him. Another had himself buried in certain lands in the mountains of Antipolo, and through reverence to him no one dared to cultivate those lands (for they feared that he who should do so would die), until an evangelical minister removed that fear from them, and now they cultivate them without harm or fear."" – Fr. Francisco Colin, Labor Evangelica (1663)

== Behaviour ==
The caterpillars feed on the leaves of guava (Psidium sp.) and oak.  They live communally in large silken nests, which can extend to 50 centimetres (20 in) or more in length.  They remain in the nests by day and leave at night to feed, laying a trail of pheromones to help them and their nest-mates navigate to and from feeding areas.
Unusually among caterpillars, E. psidii larvae can remain active for as long as 18 days with no food, which they may have to do when their host trees lose their leaves in winter.


== Use of larvae and silk ==
The larvae are among the caterpillars traded and eaten in Mexico.
The silk nests were used by the Aztecs, Mixtecs and Zapotecs to make a paper-like fabric, which was a commercial item at the time of Moctezuma.  Later, the Mixtec and other communities in Oaxaca extracted the silk fibres from the nests and wove them into sashes. This practise had ceased by 1997.

Macrosoma,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Macrosoma,genus,wikipedia.org,"Hedylidae, the ""American moth-butterflies"", is a family of insects in the order Lepidoptera, formerly representing the superfamily Hedyloidea. They have traditionally been viewed as an extant sister group of the butterfly superfamily Papilionoidea, but a 2014 phylogenetic analysis has suggested Hedylidae is a subgroup of Papilionoidea, and not a sister group, and are more accurately referred to as butterflies rather than moths. They are represented by a single Neotropical genus, Macrosoma, with 35 currently recognized species.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Hedylidae were previously treated as a tribe of Geometridae: Oenochrominae, the ""Hedylicae"". Prout considered they might even merit treatment as their own family. Scoble first considered them to be a hitherto unrecognised group of butterflies and also suggested Hedylidae might possibly constitute the sister group of the ""true"" butterflies (Papilionoidea), rather than of (Hesperioidea + Papilionoidea). Weintraub and Miller argued against this placement (but see). In 1995, Weller and Pashley found that molecular data did indeed place Hedylidae with the butterflies and a more comprehensive study in 2005 based on 57 exemplar taxa, three genes and 99 morphological characters, recovered the genus Macrosoma as sister to the (""Papilionoidea"" + Hesperioidea). However, the most recent phylogenetic analyses shows that skippers are true butterflies and therefore within the clade Papilionoidea, whereas the hedylids are a sister group that may be closely related to the obtectomeran moths. This is contrary to some earlier studies that had shown both the skippers and hedylids as being nested within the Papilionoidea.
Since there are no obvious gaps between supposed species groups, according to basic morphological structure, Scoble (1986) synonymised the five pre-existing genera of Hedylidae (33 of which had been described in Phellinodes) into the single genus Macrosoma. However, a phylogenetic analysis of all Macrosoma species is still needed.


=== Nomenclatural notes ===
In zoological nomenclature, numerous junior homonyms of Macrosoma (Hübner, 1818) exist, (Macrosoma Leach 1819 (a reptile), Macrosoma de Haan 1826 (Odonata), Macrosoma Robineau-Desvoidy 1830 (Diptera: Muscidae), Macrosoma Brandt 1835 (Coelenterata), Macrosoma Hope 1837 (Coleoptera), Macrosoma Lioy 1864 or 1865 (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), Macrosoma Hammer 1979 (Acarina: Oribatidae). To add to this potential confusion in lists of names, there exist two junior homonyms of Hedyle Guenée, 1857: Hedyle Bergh, 1895 (Opisthobranchia, ""Acochlidioidea"", Hedylopsidae; currently placed in the genus Hedylopsis Thiele, 1931), and Hedyle Malmgren 1865 (a polychaete worm). The sea slug family name ""Hedylidae Bergh, 1895"" (type species Hedyle weberi Bergh, 1895) is thus also invalid.


== Morphology and identification ==
The eggs of hedylid moths have an upright configuration and are variable in shape: in Macrosoma inermis they are particularly narrow and spindle-shaped, resembling those of some Pieridae, and in the case of M. tipulata they are more barrel-shaped, like certain Nymphalidae. The larvae resemble (probably convergently) those of Apaturinae. Adult hedylids resemble geometer moths. They share many morphological and genetic characteristics with both the superfamilies Papilionoidea and the Hesperioidea. The abdomen is very long and slim, like many Neotropical butterflies of the subfamilies Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, hence the name of one Macrosoma species ""heliconiaria"". Unlike other butterflies, however, the antennae are un-clubbed, but rather filiform or bipectinate. Unlike the family Geometridae, in which they had been placed by the geometer expert L.B.Prout, hedylids lack tympanic organs at the base of the abdomen, but have them on the wings (see under Behaviour). Unlike other butterflies, however (except the unique case of the remarkable Australian skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia, whose males possess these structures), the single-spined frenulum and retinaculum are not lost or reduced in males, except in three Macrosoma species where there is no functional wing coupling system. The retinaculum is always lost in females, and the frenulum may be vestigial. The family have been fully catalogued and illustrated in an identification guide.


=== Butterfly-like characteristics of Hedylidae ===
""Mesoscutum"" with ""secondary line of weakness"" near median ""notal"" wing process, as in some representatives of Papilionidea and Hesperioidea (potentially unique butterfly character;
Mesothoracic aorta with horizontal chamber, as in other butterflies (not Papilionidae), but as also in Cossidae;
Metathoracic ""furca"" resembling a blunt arrowhead; this a variable but potentially unique character in butterflies;
Second median plate of forewing base lying partly under the base of vein ""1A+2A"", unlike the configuration in moths;
""Postspiracular bar"" on first abdominal segment;
Female genitalic ""anterior apophyses"" reduced;
Male genitalia relatively ""deep"" dorso-ventrally;
Abdomen curved (especially in males), as in papilionoids;
Abdominal first tergal segment is strongly ""pouched"" (Scoble 1986; as also in Thyatirinae moths;
""Precoxal"" sulcus joining ""marginopleural"" sulcus;
Male Foreleg pretarsus lost, thus fused into two elements as in nymphalid butterflies, with the mid and hindlegs used for perching, but apparently redeveloped in hesperiids;
Egg upright, spindle-shaped and ribbed as in some Pieridae (e.g. the orange tip butterfly), some other butterflies, and as in some moth groups also;
Larva with ""anal comb"", as in some Hesperioidea (not however Megathyminae) and Pieridae, but not in other Papilionoidea except one species (and also independently in Tortricidae), that is used for propulsion of frass away from the caterpillar;
Caterpillar with horn-like processes and a ""bifid"" tail as in many Nymphalidae;
Caterpillar with ""secondary setae"", as in Pieridae;
Ventral larval proleg ""crochet"" hooks not forming a complete circle, unlike configuration in hesperiids and papilionoids;
Pupa affixed to the substrate via a silken girdle around the 1st abdominal segment, like in Pieridae (as also in some Geometridae, especially the subfamily Sterrhinae (in which the girdle is around the abdomen), but lost in many Papilionoidea);
Pupal cocoon lost, as in papilionoids, and a few other groups of Lepidoptera;
""Temporal cleavage line"" lost in the pupa (as in papilionoids).


== Distribution ==
Hedylidae range in North America south from central Mexico and in South America through the Amazon from southern Peru (where there are a full 26 species, up to 12 at a single site: to central Bolivia and southwestern Brazil). In the Caribbean, they also occur in Cuba, Jamaica, and Trinidad.


== Behaviour ==
Hedylids are attracted to artificial lights, but occasionally some species can be found flying by day. Thus, they may be involved in some mimicry complexes with Ithomiinae (e.g. the female only of Macrosoma lucivittata). A few species are white and resemble pierid butterflies (e.g. Macrosoma napiaria). Based on a study of Macrosoma heliconiaria, it has been found that hedylids have tympanic organs on their forewings for hearing apparently homologous to the ""Vogel's organ"" in some Papilionoidea that would help them evade bats at night. They have been shown to exhibit typical moth evasive behaviour towards bats such as erratic spiralling movements and dives. The resting posture is often at a curious angle, with the thorax tilted and the posterior edge of the hindwings nearly touching the substrate (Scoble, 1986). The larvae which lack the prominent horns in the first instar tend to rest on the midrib of the leaf and often skeletonise leaves or at either side produce an untidy patchwork of holes. The elegant pupa is attached by a cremaster and silken girdle and sometimes resembles a bird dropping.


== List of species ==
This list of species is largely based on phenetic characters.


== Biology and host plants ==
The life history of Macrosoma heliconiaria was originally described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into the biology of hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably ""I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I was sure it was a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid"". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span a wide range of (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea). The ""green lizard caterpillar"" Macrosoma tipulata attacks an economically important local fruit tree ""Cupuaçu"" (Theobroma grandiflorum) in Brazil and can defoliate saplings; the biology of this species has been studied and illustrated in some detail. The larva of this species lives about 15 days in 5 instars, the pupal stage lasts about 7 days and the adult lives about 10 days. M. tipulata and many other species can be found as adults through most of the year.


== DNA sequences ==
A few species have been sequenced for the mitochondrial genes ""cytochrome oxidase I"", and ""ND1"" and nuclear genes ""Wingless"" and ""Ef-1"", including Macrosoma semiermis. Some species are currently being barcoded.

== ""Venezuelan poodle moth"" ==
In 2009, Kyrgyzstani zoologist Dr. Arthur Anker photographed a moth in the Canaima National Park of the Gran Sabana region of Venezuela, and the photograph went ""viral"" on the internet, including hoaxes claiming to be additional photos. Anker initially captioned his photo as ""Poodle moth, Venezuela"", and later added "" (Artace sp, perhaps A. cribaria)"".
Dr. John E. Rawlins from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History concurred with Anker's suggestion of the genus Artace for the identification:

Here’s my vote/guess to ID the poodle moth. The antenna is distinctive. ""Lasiocampidae: Artace or a related genus, probably not Artace cribraria (presumably North America to Argentina, but nobody has revised this group from Mexico south). There are more than a dozen described South American species of Artace, but their delimitation, validity, and even their generic placement is uncertain. It will take two things to solve this problem: a comprehensive revision of Artace and kin, plus an actual specimen of a genuine “Venezuelan poodle moth.”

Euxoa,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Euxoa,genus,wikipedia.org,"Euxoa is a genus of moths of the family Noctuidae erected by the German entomologist, Jacob Hübner. 
The genus is mostly confined to dry and semi dry areas in the northern hemisphere. There 130 species in Eurasia, a few in Africa, and 175 in North America. There are no species in the genus in South-East Asia or in Australia. In North America, most species are found in western regions. Of the North American species, four are endemic to Mexico. There is one species recorded from Chile, but this may be a mislabeled specimen. 
In real terms, species numbers do not equal species abundance. Some areas with few species have large numbers of the ones that do live there. 
In North America there are seven subgenera; Chorizagrotis, Palaeoeuxoa, Heteroeuxoa, Longivesica, Pleuonectopoda, Orstagrotis, and Euxoa.
The larvae of this genus are cutworms, living in the soil but feeding on the surface. A few species also climb. Most larval Euxoa hatch from eggs laid in autumn, and most go though a summer diapause, before pupating when the temperature drops later in the summer. 
The genus includes the prolific miller moths, which are full adult army cutworms labeled as the species Euxoa auxiliaris and common in North America.

== Definition of agrapha ==
According to A. J. Maas, supposed agrapha must satisfy three conditions:

They must be sayings, not discourses – works like the ""Didascalia"" and the ""Pistis Sophia"", that speak of Jesus, but do not quote him, are not considered agrapha
They must be sayings of Jesus – agrapha are not sayings found in religious romances such as those found in apocryphal Gospels, the apocryphal Acts, or the Letter of Christ to Abgar, etc.
They must not be in the canonical Gospels
Mere additions to pre-existing sayings are not considered agrapha.


== Examples ==
According to A. J. Maas, for agrapha to be genuine, they must be supported by external and internal evidence. This means that early writers, like Papias, Clement, Irenaeus, and Justin Martyr would have quoted them, and the message of the agrapha must not conflict with the teachings of Jesus contained in the canonical Gospels.


=== New Testament ===
Acts 20:35: ""Remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.""


=== Church Orders ===
Apostolic Church Order, 26: ""For he said to us before, when he was teaching: That which is weak shall be saved through that which is strong.""


=== Patristic citations ===
Clement of Rome, First Epistle of Clement, 13: ""For thus He spoke: 'Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so shall it be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the same it shall be measured to you.'""
Polycarp of Smyrna, Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, 2, ""but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: 'Judge not, that ye be not judged; forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again;' and once more, 'Blessed are the poor, and those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God.'""
Papias of Hierapolis, The Expositions of the Saying of the Lord, 4: ""As the elders who saw John the disciple of the Lord remembered that they had heard from him how the Lord taught in regard to those times, and said: 'The days will come in which vines shall grow, having each ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in every one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five-and-twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me.' In like manner, [He said] that a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear would have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds of clear, pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass would produce in similar proportions; and that all animals, feeding then only on the productions of the earth, would become peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect subjection to man.'""
Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, 47: ""Wherefore also our Lord Jesus Christ said, In whatsoever things I apprehend you, in those I shall judge you.""
Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, I, 24, 158: ""For ask, he says for the great things, and the small shall be added to you.""
Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, I, 28, 177: ""Rightly therefore the Scripture also in its desire to make us such dialecticians, exhorts us: Be approved moneychangers, disapproving some things, but holding fast that which is good.""
Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, V, 10, 64: ""For not grudgingly, he saith, did the Lord declare in a certain gospel: My mystery is for me and for the sons of my house.""
Origen, Homily on Jeremiah, XX, 3: ""But the Saviour himself saith: He who is near me is near the fire; he who is far from me, is far from the kingdom."" This saying is in the Gospel of Thomas (Saying 82).

Magusa,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Magusa,genus,wikipedia.org,"Famagusta, also known by several other names, is a city located on the eastern Coast of Cyprus. It is located east of the capital, Nicosia, and possesses the deepest harbour of the island. During the Middle Ages (especially under the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice), Famagusta was the island's most important port city and a gateway to trade with the ports of the Levant, from where the Silk Road merchants carried their goods to Western Europe.


== Names ==
The city was known as Arsinoe or Arsinoë (Ancient Greek: Ἀρσινόη, Arsinóē) in antiquity, after Ptolemy II of Egypt's sister and wife Arsinoe II.
By the 3rd century, the city appears as Ammochostos (Ancient Greek: Ἀμμόχωστος or Αμμόχωστος, Ammókhōstos, ""Hidden in Sand"") in the Stadiasmus Maris Magni. This name is still used in modern Greek with the pronunciation [aˈmoxostos], while it developed into Latin Fama Augusta, French Famagouste, Italian Famagosta, and English Famagusta during the medieval period. Its informal modern Turkish name Mağusa (Turkish pronunciation: [maˈusa]) came from the same source. On 25 December 1975, the formal name in Northern Cyprus was changed by an act of parliament to Gazimağusa ([ɡaːzimaˈusa]) with the addition of the title gazi, meaning ""veteran"".
In the early medieval period, the city was also known as New Justiniana (Ancient Greek: Νέα Ἰουστινιανία, Néa Ioustinianía) in appreciation for the patronage of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, whose wife Theodora was born there.
The old town of Famagusta has also been nicknamed ""the City of 365 Churches"" from the legend that, at its peak, it boasted a church for every day of the year.


== History ==
The city was founded around 274 BC, after the serious damage to Salamis by an earthquake, by Ptolemy II Philadelphus and named ""Arsinoe"" after his sister. Arsinoe was described as a ""fishing town"" by Strabo in his Geographica in the first century BC. In essence, Famagusta was the successor of the most famous and most important ancient city of Cyprus, Salamis. According to Greek mythology, Salamis was founded after the end of the Trojan War by Teucros, the son of Telamon and brother of Aedes, from the Greek island of Salamis.


=== Byzantine conquest ===
The city experienced great prosperity much later, during the time of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. To honor the city, from which his wife Theodora came, Justinian enriched it with many buildings, while the inhabitants named it New Justiniania to express their gratitude. In AD 647, when the neighboring cities were destroyed by Arab raiding, the inhabitants of these cities moved to Famagusta, as a result of which the city's population increased significantly and the city experienced another boom.


=== Arab conquest ===
Later, when Jerusalem was occupied by the Arabs, the Christian population fled to Famagusta, as a result of which the city became an important Christian center, but also one of the most important commercial centers in the eastern Mediterranean.


=== Medieval Famagusta ===

The turning point for Famagusta was 1192 with the onset of Lusignan rule. It was during this period that Famagusta developed as a fully-fledged town. It increased in importance to the Eastern Mediterranean due to its natural harbour and the walls that protected its inner town. Its population began to increase. This development accelerated in the 13th century as the town became a centre of commerce for both the East and West. An influx of Christian refugees fleeing the downfall of Acre (1291) in Palestine transformed it from a tiny village into one of the richest cities in Christendom.
In 1372 the port was seized by Genoa and in 1489 by Venice. This commercial activity turned Famagusta into a place where merchants and ship owners led lives of luxury. By the mid-14th century, Famagusta was said to have the richest citizens in the world. The belief that people's wealth could be measured by the churches they built inspired these merchants to have churches built in varying styles. These churches, which still exist, were the reason Famagusta came to be known as ""the district of churches"". The development of the town focused on the social lives of the wealthy people and was centred upon the Lusignan palace, the cathedral, the Square and the harbour.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Ottoman Famagusta ===

In 1570–1571, Famagusta was the last stronghold in Venetian Cyprus to hold out against the Turks under Mustafa Pasha. It resisted a siege of thirteen months and a terrible bombardment, until at last the garrison surrendered. The Ottoman forces had lost 50,000 men, including Mustafa Pasha's son. Although the surrender terms had stipulated that the Venetian forces be allowed to return home, the Venetian commander, Marco Antonio Bragadin, was flayed alive, his lieutenant Tiepolo was hanged, and many other Christians were killed.

With the advent of the Ottoman rule, Latins lost their privileged status in Famagusta and were expelled from the city. Greek Cypriots natives were at first allowed to own and buy property in the city, but were banished from the walled city in 1573–74 and had to settle outside in the area that later developed into Varosha. Turkish families from Anatolia were resettled in the walled city but could not fill the buildings that previously hosted a population of 10,000. This caused a drastic decrease in the population of Famagusta. Merchants from Famagusta, who mostly consisted of Latins that had been expelled, resettled in Larnaca and as Larnaca flourished, Famagusta lost its importance as a trade centre. Over time, Varosha developed into a prosperous agricultural town thanks to its location away from the marshes, whilst the walled city remained dilapidated.
In the walled city, some buildings were repurposed to serve the interests of the Muslim population: the Cathedral of St. Nicholas was converted to a mosque (now known as Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque), a bazaar was developed, public baths, fountains and a theological school were built to accommodate the inhabitants' needs. Dead end streets, an Ottoman urban characteristic, was imported to the city and a communal spirit developed in which a small number of two-storey houses inhabited by the small upper class co-existed with the widespread one-storey houses.


=== British rule ===

With the British takeover, Famagusta regained its significance as a port and an economic centre and its development was specifically targeted in British plans. As soon as the British took over the island, a Famagusta Development Act was passed that aimed at the reconstruction and redevelopment of the city's streets and dilapidated buildings as well as better hygiene. The port was developed and expanded between 1903 and 1906 and Cyprus Government Railway, with its terminus in Famagusta, started construction in 1904. Whilst Larnaca continued to be used as the main port of the island for some time, after Famagusta's use as a military base in World War I trade significantly shifted to Famagusta. The city outside the walls grew at an accelerated rate, with development being centred around Varosha. Varosha became the administrative centre as the British moved their headquarters and residences there and tourism grew significantly in the last years of the British rule. Pottery and production of citrus and potatoes also significantly grew in the city outside the walls, whilst agriculture within the walled city declined to non-existence.
New residential areas were built to accommodate the increasing population towards the end of the British rule, and by 1960, Famagusta was a modern port city extending far beyond Varosha and the walled city.
The British period saw a significant demographic shift in the city. In 1881, Christians constituted 60% of the city's population while Muslims were at 40%. By 1960, the Turkish Cypriot population had dropped to 17.5% of the overall population, while the Greek Cypriot population had risen to 70%. The city was also the site for one of the British internment camps for nearly 50,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust trying to emigrate to Palestine.


=== From independence to the Turkish invasion ===

From independence in 1960 to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus of 1974, Famagusta developed toward the south west of Varosha as a well-known entertainment and tourist centre. The contribution of Famagusta to the country's economic activity by 1974 far exceeded its proportional dimensions within the country. Whilst its population was only about 7% of the total of the country, Famagusta by 1974 accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus, concentrating mainly on light industry compatible with its activity as a tourist resort and turning out high-quality products ranging from food, beverages and tobacco to clothing, footwear, plastics, light machinery and transport equipment. It contributed 19.3% of the business units and employed 21.3% of the total number of persons engaged in commerce on the island. It acted as the main tourist destination of Cyprus, hosting 31.5% of the hotels and 45% of Cyprus' total bed capacity. Varosha acted as the main touristic and business quarters.
In this period, the urbanisation of Famagusta slowed down and the development of the rural areas accelerated. Therefore, economic growth was shared between the city of Famagusta and the district, which had a balanced agricultural economy, with citrus, potatoes, tobacco and wheat as main products. Famagusta maintained good communications with this hinterland. The city's port remained the island's main seaport and in 1961, it was expanded to double its capacity in order to accommodate the growing volume of exports and imports. The port handled 42.7% of Cypriot exports, 48.6% of imports and 49% of passenger traffic.
There has not been an official census since 1960 but the population of the town in 1974 was estimated to be around 39,000 not counting about 12,000–15,000 persons commuting daily from the surrounding villages and suburbs to work in Famagusta. The number of people staying in the city would swell to about 90,000–100,000 during the peak summer tourist period, with the influx of tourists from numerous European countries, mainly Britain, France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. The majority of the city population were Greek Cypriots (26,500), with 8,500 Turkish Cypriots and 4,000 people from other ethnic groups.


=== From the Turkish reinvasion to the present ===

During the second phase of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 14 August 1974 the Mesaoria plain was overrun by Turkish tanks and Famagusta was bombed by Turkish aircraft. It took two days for the Turkish Army to occupy the city, prior to which Famagusta's entire Greek Cypriot population had fled into surrounding fields. As a result of Turkish airstrikes dozens of civilians died, including tourists.
Unlike other parts of the Turkish-controlled areas of Cyprus, the Varosha suburb of Famagusta was fenced off by the Turkish army immediately after being captured and remained fenced off until October 2020, when the TRNC reopened some streets to visitors. Some Greek Cypriots who had fled Varosha have been allowed to view the town and journalists have been allowed in.
UN Security Council resolution 550 (1984) considers any attempts to settle any part of Famagusta by people other than its inhabitants as inadmissible and unjust and calls for the transfer of this area to the administration of the UN. The UN's Security Council resolution 789 (1992) also urges that with a view to the implementation of resolution 550 (1984), the area at present under the control of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus be extended to include Varosha.

== Cityscape ==

Famagusta's historic city centre is surrounded by the fortifications of Famagusta, which have a roughly rectangular shape, built mainly by the Venetians in the 15th and 16th centuries, though some sections of the walls have been dated earlier times, as far as 1211. Some important landmarks and visitor attractions in the old city are:

The Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque
The Othello Castle
Palazzo del Provveditore - the Venetian palace of the governor, built on the site of the former Lusignan royal palace
St. Francis' Church
Sinan Pasha Mosque
Church of St. George of the Greeks
Church of St. George of the Latins
Twin Churches
Nestorian Church (of St George the Exiler)
Namık Kemal Dungeon
Agios Ioannis Church
Venetian House
Akkule Masjid
Mustafa Pasha Mosque
Ganchvor monastery
In an October 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, Global Heritage Fund listed Famagusta, a ""maritime ancient city of crusader kings"", among the 12 sites most ""On the Verge"" of irreparable loss and destruction, citing insufficient management and development pressures.


== Economy ==

Famagusta is an important commercial hub of Northern Cyprus. The main economic activities in the city are tourism, education, construction and industrial production. It has a 115-acre free port, which is the most important seaport of Northern Cyprus for travel and commerce. The port is an important source of income and employment for the city, though its volume of trade is restricted by the embargo against Northern Cyprus. Its historical sites, including the walled city, Salamis, the Othello Castle and the St Barnabas Church, as well as the sandy beaches surrounding it make it a tourist attraction; efforts are also underway to make the city more attractive for international congresses. The Eastern Mediterranean University is also an important employer and supplies significant income and activity, as well as opportunities for the construction sector. The university also raises a qualified workforce that stimulates the city's industry and makes communications industry viable. The city has two industrial zones: the Large Industrial Zone and the Little Industrial Zone. The city is also home to a fishing port, but inadequate infrastructure of the port restricts the growth of this sector. The industry in the city has traditionally been concentrated on processing agricultural products.
Historically, the port was the primary source of income and employment for the city, especially right after 1974. However, it gradually lost some of its importance to the economy as the share of its employees in the population of Famagusta diminished due to various reasons. However, it still is the primary port for commerce in Northern Cyprus, with more than half of ships that came to Northern Cyprus in 2013 coming to Famagusta. It is the second most popular seaport for passengers, after Kyrenia, with around 20,000 passengers using the port in 2013.


== Politics ==
The mayor-in-exile of Famagusta is Simos Ioannou. Süleyman Uluçay heads the Turkish Cypriot municipal administration of Famagusta, which remains legal as a communal-based body under the constitutional system of the Republic of Cyprus.
Since 1974, Greek Cypriots submitted a number of proposals within the context of bicommunal discussions for the return of Varosha to UN administration, allowing the return of its previous inhabitants, requesting also the opening of Famagusta harbour for use by both communities. Varosha would have been returned to Greek Cypriot control as part of the 2004 Annan Plan but the plan had been rejected by a majority(3/4) of Greek Cypriot voters.


== Culture ==

The walled city of Famagusta contains many unique buildings. Famagusta has a walled city popular with tourists.
Every year, the International Famagusta Art and Culture Festival is organized in Famagusta. Concerts, dance shows and theater plays take place during the festival.
A growth in tourism and the city's university have fueled the development of Famagusta's vibrant nightlife. Nightlife in the city is especially active on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights and in the hotter months of the year, starting from April. Larger hotels in the city have casinos that cater to their customers. Salamis Road is an area of Famagusta with a heavy concentration of bars frequented by students and locals.
Famagusta's Othello Castle is the setting for Shakespeare's play Othello. The city was also the setting for Victoria Hislop's 2015 novel The Sunrise, and Michael Paraskos's 2016 novel In Search of Sixpence. The city is the birthplace of the eponymous hero of the Renaissance proto-novel Fortunatus.


== Sports ==

Famagusta was home to many Greek Cypriot sport teams that left the city because of the Turkish invasion and still bear their original names. Most notable football clubs originally from the city are Anorthosis Famagusta FC and Nea Salamis Famagusta FC, both of the Cypriot First Division, which are now based in Larnaca. Usually Anorthosis Famagusta fans are politically right wing where Nea Salamis fans are left wing.
Famagusta is represented by Mağusa Türk Gücü in the Turkish Cypriot First Division. Dr. Fazıl Küçük Stadium is the largest football stadium in Famagusta. Many Turkish Cypriot sport teams that left Southern Cyprus because of the Cypriot intercommunal violence are based in Famagusta.
Famagusta is represented by DAÜ Sports Club and Magem Sports Club in North Cyprus First Volleyball Division. Gazimağusa Türk Maarif Koleji represents Famagusta in the North Cyprus High School Volleyball League.
Famagusta has a modern volleyball stadium called the Mağusa Arena.


== Education ==

The Eastern Mediterranean University was founded in the city in 1979. The Istanbul Technical University founded a campus in the city in 2010.
The Cyprus College of Art was founded in Famagusta by the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos in 1969, before moving to Paphos in 1972 after protests from local hoteliers that the presence of art students in the city was putting off holidaymakers.


== Healthcare ==
Famagusta has three general hospitals. Gazimağusa Devlet Hastahanesi, a state hospital, is the biggest hospital in city. Gazimağusa Tıp Merkezi and Gazimağusa Yaşam Hastahanesi are private hospitals.

Trachea,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Trachea,genus,wikipedia.org,"The trachea (pl.: tracheae or tracheas), also known as the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all animals' lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At the top of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx. The trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped rings, joined together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by the trachealis muscle at their ends. The epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.
The trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo development, becoming longer and more fixed in its position over time. Its epithelium is lined with column-shaped cells that have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells that produce protective mucins. The trachea can be affected by inflammation or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness affecting other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, called croup, that can result in a cough. Infection with bacteria usually affects the trachea only and can cause narrowing or even obstruction. As a major part of the respiratory tract, the trachea, when obstructed, prevents air from entering the lungs; thus, a tracheostomy may be required. Additionally, during surgery, if mechanical ventilation is required during anaesthesia, a tube is inserted into the trachea: this is called tracheal intubation.
The word trachea is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.


== Structure ==

An adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about 1.5 to 2 centimetres (1⁄2 to 3⁄4 in) and a length of about 10 to 11 cm (4 to 4+1⁄4 in), wider in males than females. The trachea begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx at the level of sixth cervical vertebra (C6) and ends at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into left and right main bronchi., at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), although its position may change with breathing. The trachea is surrounded by 16–20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped. Ligaments connect the rings. The trachealis muscle connects the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea. Also adventitia, which is the outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage, contributes to the trachea's ability to bend and stretch with movement.
Although trachea is a midline structure, it can be  displaced normally to the right by the aortic arch.


=== Nearby structures ===
The trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest (thorax) along its course.
In front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin. Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular arch, which joins the two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea. The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles stretch along its length. The thyroid gland also stretches across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the second to fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or sixth cartilage. The blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior thyroid veins below it. In front of the lower trachea lies the manubrium of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. To the front left lie the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid artery and the brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. The deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also positioned in front of the lower trachea.
Behind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by connective tissue and the vertebral column. To its sides run the carotid arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back surface run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves in the lower trachea.
The trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing the size of the lumen of the trachea.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Blood and lymphatic supply ===

The upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the inferior thyroid arteries and veins; the lower trachea receives blood from bronchial arteries. Arteries that supply the trachea do so via small branches that supply the trachea from the sides. As the branches approach the wall of the trachea, they split into inferior and superior branches, which join with the branches of the arteries above and below; these then split into branches that supply the anterior and posterior parts of the trachea. The inferior thyroid arteries arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop the trachea. These arteries join (anastamoses) with ascending branches of the bronchial arteries, which are direct branches from the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea. The lymphatic vessels of the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in front of the trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.


=== Development ===
In the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates from the foregut through the formation of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal septum. This separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and divides the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube. By the start of the fifth week, the left and right main bronchi have begun to form, initially as buds at the terminal end of the trachea.
The trachea is no more than 4 mm in diameter during the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of approximately 2 cm by late childhood. The trachea is more circular and more vertical in children compared to adults, varies more in size, and also varies more in its position in relation to its surrounding structures.


=== Microanatomy ===
The trachea is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia. The epithelium contains goblet cells,  which are glandular, column-shaped cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus helps to moisten and protect the airways. Mucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. This self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance. Directly beneath this mucus layer lies the submucosa layer which is composed primarily of fibrous connective tissue and connects the mucosa to the rings of hyaline cartilage beneath.
The trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are incomplete and C-shaped. Two or more of the cartilages often unite, partially or completely, and they are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. The rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Function ==
The trachea's main function is to transport air to and from the lungs. It also helps to warm, humidify, and filter the air before it reaches the lungs.
The trachea is made up of rings of cartilage, which help to keep it open and prevent it from collapsing. The inside of the trachea is lined with a mucous membrane, which produces mucus to help trap dirt and dust particles. The cilia, which are tiny hairs that line the mucous membrane, help to move the mucus and trapped particles up and out of the trachea.


== Clinical significance ==


=== Inflammation and infection ===
Inflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually due to an infection. It is usually caused by viral infections, with bacterial infections occurring almost entirely in children. Most commonly, infections occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, known as croup, however bacterial infections may also affect the trachea alone, although they are often associated with a recent viral infection. Viruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses 1–3, with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious infections; bacteria may also cause croup and include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Causes of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In patients who are in hospital, additional bacteria that may cause tracheitis include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
A person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cough, sore throat, or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. Fevers may develop and an affected child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis. Swelling of the airway can cause narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor, or even cause complete blockage. Up to 80% of people affected by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation, and treatment may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens for culture and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated with the infection. Treatment in such situations usually includes antibiotics.


=== Narrowing ===

A trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result of enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby structures; large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other processes such as unusually swollen blood vessels. Scarring from tracheobronchial injury or intubation; or inflammation associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause a narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis). Obstruction invariably causes a harsh breathing sound known as stridor. A camera inserted via the mouth down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be performed to investigate the cause of an obstruction. Management of obstructions depends on the cause. Obstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  A stent may be inserted over the obstruction. Benign lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are likely to be surgically excised.
One cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the trachea to collapse when there is increased external pressure, such as when airflow is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased compliance. It can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such as compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma. Congenital tracheomalacia can occur by itself or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia or laryngomalacia, and abnormal connections between the trachea and the oesophagus, amongst others. Congenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and muscarinic agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea; positive pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of a stent, or the removal of the affected part of the trachea. In dogs, particularly miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as bronchomalacia, can lead to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like cough.


=== Injury ===
The trachea may be injured by trauma such as in a vehicle accident, or intentionally by another wilfully inflicting damage for example as practiced in some martial arts.


=== Intubation ===

Tracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down the trachea. This procedure is commonly performed during surgery, in order to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.
In an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept open. The provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy. Another method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this is a cricothyrotomy.


=== Congenital disorders ===

Tracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails to develop. The defect is usually fatal though sometimes surgical intervention has been successful.
A tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the trachea and esophagus are abnormally connected (a fistula). This is because of abnormalities in the separation between the trachea and oesophagus during development. This occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 births, and the most common abnormalities is a separation of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end finishing in a closed pouch. Other abnormalities may be associated with this, including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome. Such fistulas may be detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth, they are often associated with pneumonitis and pneumonia because of aspiration of food contents. Congenital fistulas are often treated by surgical repair. In adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. Initially, these often result in coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that are aspirated through the trachea, often progressing to fatal pneumonia; there is rarely a curative treatment. A tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who has had their larynx removed. Air travels upwards from the surgical connection to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx, creating vibrations that create sound that can be used for speech. The purpose of the puncture is to restore a person's ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.
Sometimes as an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete rings, rather than horseshoe shaped rings. These O rings are smaller than the normal C-shaped rings and can cause narrowing (stenosis) of the trachea, resulting in breathing difficulties. An operation called a slide tracheoplasty can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of the trachea. Slide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating tracheal stenosis.
Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally enlarged trachea, characterised by absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning, and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.


=== Replacement ===
From 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those grown from stem cells, or with synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded as experimental and there is no standardised method. Difficulties with ensuring adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge to any replacement. Additionally, no evidence has been found to support the placement of stem cells taken from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating tissue regeneration, and such a method remains hypothetical.
In January 2021, surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea transplantation. The 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from a donor and implanting it in the patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.


== Other animals ==
Allowing for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in general, similar to that in humans. Generally, it is also similar to the reptilian trachea.


=== Vertebrates ===
In birds, the trachea runs from the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. Swans have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. In some birds, the tracheal rings are complete, and may even be ossified.
In amphibians, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi. A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians. While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.
The only vertebrates to have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the Polypterus, in which the lungs arise directly from the pharynx.


=== Invertebrates ===

The word trachea is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues. The distribution of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. The tracheae are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8 mm. Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the smallest tubes, called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells. Gas may be conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation or passive diffusion. Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their hemolymph.
This is one of the factors that may limit their size.
A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. Taenidia provide strength and flexibility to the trachea. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and are shed during moulting (ecdysis).

Diastema,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Diastema,genus,wikipedia.org,"A diastema (pl.: diastemata, from Greek διάστημα, 'space') is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. More colloquially, the condition may be referred to as gap teeth or tooth gap.
In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth).  It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well.


== In humans ==


=== Causes ===
1. Oversized Labial Frenulum: Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart.
2. Periodontal Disease: Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, can result in bone loss that supports the teeth. If a person loses enough bone, the teeth can become loose and cause gaps to form.
3. Mesiodens: Mesiodens is an extra tooth that grows behind the front teeth. A mesiodens may push the front teeth apart to make room for itself thus creating a gap between the front teeth.
4. Skeletal discrepancy: Dental skeletal discrepancy can be a cause behind gap teeth. If the upper jaw grows more than the lower jaw, teeth on the upper jaw will have more space to cover thus leaving gaps between them.
5. Proclination: If the front teeth are angled forward, a small gap between them may appear large. This is called proclination; it may be a result of aggressive tongue thrusting.


=== Treatment ===
A diastema is not a pathology and doesn't require treatment. Any interventions to modify a diastema are purely cosmetic. 
1. Determine the cause of the diastema, then treat the cause.
2. Diastema treatment options can differ from one patient to another, but generally it is treated by orthodontics, or composite fillings, or a combination of veneers or crowns.


== Historical and popular culture references ==
In The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote of the ""gap-toothed wife of Bath"". As early as this time period, the gap between the front teeth, especially in women, was associated with lustful characteristics. Thus, the implication in describing ""the gap-toothed wife of Bath"" is that she is a middle-aged woman with insatiable lust.
In Ghana, Namibia and Nigeria, as well as throughout many communities in Kenya, diastemata are regarded as being attractive and a sign of fertility, and some people have even had them created through cosmetic dentistry. 
In France, they are called dents du bonheur (lucky/happiness teeth). This expression originated in Napoleon's time: when the Napoleonic army recruited, it was imperative that soldiers had incisors in perfect condition because they had to open the paper cartridges (containing gunpowder) with their teeth when loading their muskets. All those who had teeth apart were then classified as unfit to fight. Some men broke their own teeth to avoid going to war. 
Les Blank's Gap-Toothed Women (1987) is a 30-minute documentary film about diastematic women.

Phyle,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Phyle,genus,wikipedia.org,"Phyle (Greek: φυλή, romanized: phulē, lit. 'tribe, clan'; pl. phylai, φυλαί; derived from Greek φύεσθαι, phyesthai lit. 'to descend, to originate') is an ancient Greek term for tribe or clan. Members of the same phyle were known as symphyletai (Greek: συμφυλέται) meaning 'fellow tribesmen'. During the late 6th century BC, Cleisthenes organized the population of Athens in ten phylai (tribes), each consisting of three trittyes (""thirtieths""), with each trittys comprising a number of demes. Tribes and demes had their own officers and were self-administered. Some phylai can be classified by their geographic location, such as the Geleontes, the Argadeis, the Hopletes, and the Agikoreis in Ionia, as well as the Hylleans, the Pamphyles, the Dymanes in Doris.


== Attic tribes ==


=== First period ===
The best-attested new system was that created by Cleisthenes for Attica in or just after 508 BC. The landscape was regarded as comprising three zones: urban (asty), coastal (paralia) and inland (mesogeia). Each zone was split into ten sections called trittyes ('thirdings'), to each of which were assigned between one and ten of the 139 existing settlements, villages or town-quarters, which were henceforth called demoi. 
Three sections, one each from urban, coastal and inland, were then put together to form a tribe. The 30 sections therefore yielded ten tribes, each named after a local hero and each with a geographically scattered membership roughly equal in size and hereditary in the male line thenceforward. They rapidly took on various functions.
They became the brigading units for the army; constituencies for the election of magistrates, especially the ten generals (strategoi), for the section of members of the Council of 500 (boule) and of the 6,000 jurors, and for the selection of boards of administrative officials of every kind: and bases for the selection of competing teams of runners, singers or dancers at various festivals. They had their own corporate life, with officials and sanctuaries, and came to have an official order:
1. Erechtheis (Ἐρεχθηΐς)
2. Aigeis (Αἰγηΐς)
3. Pandionis (Πανδιονίς)
4. Leontis (Λεοντίς)
5. Acamantis (Ἀκαμαντίς)
6. Oineis (Οἰνηΐς)
7. Kekropis (Κεκροπίς)
8. Hippothontis (Ἱπποθοντίς)
9. Aiantis (Αἰαντίς)
10. Antiochis (Ἀντιοχίς).


=== Subsequent periods ===
After this so called Period I that lasted until 307/306 BC, the system of Phylae had undergone few changes:

in Period II (307/306 – 224/223 BC) two Macedonian Phylai were created (XI. Antigonis and XII. Demetrias);
in Period III (224/223 – 201/200 BC) an Egyptian Phyle XIII. Ptolemais was created;
in Period IV (201/200 BC – 126/127 AD) the Macedonian Phylae were dissolved and a Tribe XIV. Attalis, was created;
in Period V (126/127 AD – third century) a tribe XV. Hadrianis was created.


== Ten tribes of Thurii ==
When the colony of Thurii on the Gulf of Taranto was settled under the support of Pericles and the command of Lampon and Xenocritus the population was organized in ten tribes, following the Athenian organization: there were tribes for the population of  1. Arcadia, 2. Achaea, 3. Elis, 4. Boeotia, 5. Delphi, 6. Dorians, 7. Ionians, 8. population of Euboea, 9. the islands and 10. Athenians.

Part of the ancient city is now submerged in the sea and remains of the Titus thermal baths lie in the water. A small theatre or bouleuterion on the acropolis within the later fort and carved into the rock can be seen.

Phyllocnistis,genus,wikipedia.org,"Phyllocnistis is a genus of moths in the family Gracillariidae.


== Description ==


=== Adult ===
Adults of the genus Phyllocnistis are very small moths with wingspans generally not exceeding 5 mm. Both fore- and hindwings are lanceolate and predominantly white. The forewings are marked with yellow to orange, longitudinal and oblique striae, often bordered by gray or black. A few species are known to possess much darker or strikingly color patterns. The compound eyes of Phyllocnistis are reduced, with an interocular index (vertical eye diameter/minimum interocular distance) of approximately 0.9. The maxillary palpi are the most reduced among Gracillariidae, being barely evident as vestigial, non-segmented lobes at the base of the elongate proboscis. The wing venation is also reduced.


=== Larvae ===
The larvae of Phyllocnistis are among the most specialized Lepidoptera. Four instars appear to be the norm, with the first three instars possessing a sapfeeding morphology and behavior. Sapfeeding instars create a long serpentine, subepidermal mine on either the upper or lower surfaces of the host leaf. A few species also form subepidermal mines on stems and various fruits, including avocado. A characteristic, median frass trail extends the length of the mine, usually as a dark, unbroken line. The fourth instar is a highly specialized, apodal, non-feeding instar whose primary function is to spin the cocoon, at the mine terminus, prior to pupation.


=== Pupae ===
In contrast to the conservative morphology of the larval and adult stages, the pupae of Phyllocnistis are structurally diverse, particularly with regard to the development of the frontal process (cocoon-cutter) of the head. In addition, the mid-dorsal areas of abdominal terga 3–7 possess a mostly symmetrical cluster of recurved spines that frequently differ in their arrangement and form among species.


== Ecology ==
Phyllocnistis can be found on many host plants, and have been noted on plants from at least 20 families. One well-known species is the citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella), a pest of plants in the family Rutaceae, especially citrus.


== Species ==
As of 2012, about 126 Phyllocnistis species have been described. This is probably a fraction of the true diversity of the genus, especially in the tropics, where there may be hundreds of species yet to be collected.

Bland de nordiska arterna finns fyra par dubbel­arter, som inte med säkerhet kan särskiljas på det yttre utseendet. En av dem, azaleastyltmal Caloptilia azaleella, förekommer inte naturligt i Norden, men då och då följer ägg, larver eller puppor med obesprutade azaleor som säljs i handelsträdgårdar.
Släktet kännetecknas bl.a. av smala, jämnbreda framvingar och mycket smala bakvingar med långa fransar. Vilande fjärilar håller främre delen av kroppen högt upplyft med fram- och mellanbenen som styltor.",662

Perizoma,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Perizoma,genus,wikipedia.org,"Perizoma is a genus in the geometer moth family (Geometridae). It is the type genus of tribe Perizomini in subfamily Larentiinae. The tribe is considered monotypic by those who include the genera Gagitodes, Martania and Mesotype in Perizoma. Some other less closely related species formerly placed here are now elsewhere in the Larentiinae, e.g. in Entephria of the tribe Larentiini.
Either way, there are more than 150 species of Perizoma currently known, with a generally Northern Hemisphere distribution (e.g. 14 occurring in Europe), and new ones still being described occasionally. Many of them are called rivulets (""the"" rivulet is P. affinitata specifically), while others are known as carpets, a common name for Larentiinae in general.
It was first described by Jacob Hübner in 1825. One of its junior synonyms is Emmelesia, proposed by James Francis Stephens no less than three times – once validly in 1829, and within the next two years twice more invalidly, covering a total of 18 species. Another invalid name of Perizoma – Opisogonia, chosen by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Schäffer in 1856 – had already been used by the same author the year before for a different geometer moth genus.

I nuläget anses släktet rymma ca 29 arter varav elva finns i Europa. De förekommer i alla världsdelar men främst i de subtropiska och tempererade delarna av Palearktis. Släktet innehåller flera taxonomiskt svårutredda artgrupper. Genitalierna är enkla i sin struktur och skiljer sig bara i liten utsträckning mellan arterna, och det har diskuterats vilken betydelse de små skillnader som ändå går att urskilja har ur ett taxonomiskt perspektiv. Särskilt vitsprötad skymningssvärmare H. euphorbiae utgörs av ett komplex av arter, underarter och former, och vissa populationer har föreslagits vara under artbildning. Det finns troligen även naturliga hybrider vilket har gjort det än svårare att klarlägga vilka taxa som kan betraktas som arter. Ytterligare undersökningar krävs med hjälp av bland annat DNA. Larvernas färger och teckningar anses kunna innehålla information för att förstå släktskapen bättre.",1182

Erechthias,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Erechthias,genus,wikipedia.org,"Erechthias is a genus of the fungus moth family, Tineidae. Therein, it belongs to the subfamily Erechthiinae, of which it is the type genus. The exact circumscription of this genus is still disputed, but it may encompass more than 150 species.


== Systematics and taxonomy ==
Here, the genus is treated in the wide circumscription (sensu lato) adopted by many authors today, and represents the presumed core group of the Erechthiinae. Delimited thus, Erechthias includes several other genera, some of which have occasionally been treated as independent even by fairly recent authors. They are still rather similar and contain moths that are (at least overwhelmingly) very closely related. Still, they differ in details such as the wing venation – with Erechthias sensu stricto having all veins separate (as opposed to e.g. the Decadarchis group, which has hindwing veins 5 and 6 stalked) – or the clasper's harpe being nude in Erechthias s.str. but bearing a cluster of setae on the costa. However, the female genitals look almost alike in all of them.
Many of these supposedly distinct genera were always considered monotypic and are unlikely to be valid. More notable are Decadarchis (including Caryolestis, Nesoxena, Pantheus, and perhaps others) and Ereunetis (including Lepidobregma and Neodecadarchis); these two are more frequently considered separate genera than other subgroups of Erechthias. The members of the former (sub)genus were in fact at first often placed in Tinea of subfamily Tineinae. Other species of Erechthias were historically assigned to Acridotarsa – also of the Tineinae (E. deloneura) – or to Mesopherna of the Myrmecozelinae (E. epomadia). E. glyphidaula has been a particular source of confusion; even veteran researcher Edward Meyrick, in some of his last works, no less than three times established a new monotypic genus for this species.
More unusually, some species of Erechthias were initially mistaken as members of the cosmet moth genus Cosmopteryx (E. cyanosticta) and the ermine moth genus Argyresthia (E. zebrina); these genera are basal Ditrysia not particularly closely related to Erechthias. The enigmatic ""genus"" Acrocenotes – a single species initially held to belong to the Plutellidae, which are also not close relatives of Erechthias – is also included here in the present treatment.
As another taxonomic curiosity of this genus, E. beeblebroxi is named after Douglas Adams's famous two-headed science fiction character Zaphod Beeblebrox; the moth has a ""false head"" pattern that presumably helps to confuse would-be predators.
Finally, the actual delimitation of Erechthias against related genera such as Comodica still needs to be determined. For example, whether the Erechthiinae Callicerastis stagmatias and Mecomodica fullawayi are justifiably separated in their monotypic genera or better included in Erechthias (as are all the other species once placed in Callicerastis) is disputed; the latter in particular seems to be somewhat intermediate between Comodica and Erechthias.

Gippius,genus,wikipedia.org,"Zinaida Nikolayevna Gippius (Russian: Зинаи́да Никола́евна Ги́ппиус, IPA: [zʲɪnɐˈidə nʲɪkɐˈlajɪvnə ˈɡʲipʲɪus] ; 20 November [O.S. 8 November] 1869 – 9 September 1945), a Russian poet, playwright, novelist, editor and religious thinker, became one of the major figures in Russian symbolism.
She began writing at an early age, and by the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888 was already a published poet. The two married in 1889. Gippius published her first book of poetry, Collection of Poems. 1889–1903, in 1903, and her second collection, Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909, in 1910. After the 1905 Revolution, the couple  became critics of Tsarism; they spent several years abroad during this time, including trips for treatment of health issues. They denounced Russia's 1917 October Revolution, seeing it as a cultural disaster, and in 1919 emigrated to Poland.
After living in Poland they moved to France, and then to Italy, continuing to publish and to take part in Russian émigré circles, though Gippius's harsh literary criticism made enemies. The tragedy of the exiled Russian writer was a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore  mystical and covertly sexual themes, publishing short stories, plays, novels, poetry, and memoirs. The death of Merezhkovsky in 1941 was a major blow to Gippius, who died a few years later in 1945.


== Biography ==
Zinaida Gippius was born on 20 November [O.S. 8 November] 1869, in Belyov, Tula, the eldest of four sisters. Her father, Nikolai Romanovich Gippius, a respected lawyer and a senior officer in the Russian Senate, was a German-Russian, whose ancestor Adolphus von Gingst, later von Hippius, came to settle in Moscow in the 16th century. Her mother, Anastasia Vasilyevna (née Stepanova), was the daughter of the Yekaterinburg Chief of Police.
Nikolai Gippius's job entailed constant traveling, and because of this his daughters received little formal education. Taking lessons from governesses and visiting tutors, they attended schools sporadically in whatever city the family happened to stay for a significant period of time  (Saratov, Tula and Kiev, among others). At the age of 48 Nikolai Gippius died of tuberculosis, and Anastasia Vasilyevna, knowing that all of her girls had inherited a predisposition to the illness that killed him, moved the family southwards, first to Yalta (where Zinaida had medical treatment) then in 1885 to Tiflis, closer to their uncle Alexander Stepanov's home.
By this time, Zinaida had already studied for two years at a girls' school in Kiev (1877—1878) and for a year at the Moscow Fischer Gymnasium. It was only in Borzhomi where her uncle Alexander, a man of considerable means, rented a dacha for her, that she started to get back to normal after the profound shock caused by her beloved father's death.
Zinaida started writing poetry at the age of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. ""By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing,"" she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.
Gippius and Merezhkovsky were married on 8 January 1889, in Tiflis. They had a short honeymoon tour involving a stay in the Crimea, then returned to Saint Petersburg and moved into a flat in the  Muruzi House, which Merezhkovsky's mother had rented and furnished for them as a wedding gift.


=== Literary career ===

Merezhkovsky and Gippius made a pact, each promising to concentrate on what he or she did best, the former on poetry, the latter on prose. The agreement collapsed as Zinaida translated Lord Byron's Manfred, and Dimitry started working on his debut novel Julian the Apostate. In Saint Petersburg Gippius joined the Russian Literary Society, became a member of the Shakespearean Circle (the celebrity lawyer Prince Alexander Urusov being its most famous member), and met and befriended  Yakov Polonsky, Apollon Maykov, Dmitry Grigorovich, Aleksey Pleshcheyev and Pyotr Veinberg. She became close to the group of authors associated with the renovated Severny Vestnik, where she herself made her major debut as a poet in 1888.
In 1890–91 this magazine published her first short stories, ""The Ill-Fated One"" and ""In Moscow"". Then three of her novels, Without the Talisman, The Winner, and Small Waves, appeared in Mir Bozhy. Seeing the writing of mediocre, generic prose as a commercial enterprise, Gippius treated her poetry differently, as something utterly intimate, calling her verses 'personal prayers'. Dealing with the darker side of the human soul and exploring sexual ambiguity and narcissism, many of those 'prayers' were considered blasphemous at the time. Detractors called Gippius a 'demoness', the 'queen of duality', and a 'decadent Madonna'. Enjoying the notoriety, she exploited her androgynous image, used male clothes and pseudonyms, shocked her guests  with insults ('to watch their reaction', as she once explained to Nadezhda Teffi), and for a decade remained the Russian symbol of 'sexual liberation', holding high what she in one of her diary entries termed as the 'cross of sensuality'. In 1901 all this transformed into the ideology of the ""New Church"" of which she was the instigator.
In October 1903 the Collection of Poems. 1889–1903, Gippius's first book of poetry, came out; Innokenty Annensky later called the book the ""quintessence of fifteen years of Russian modernism."" Valery Bryusov was greatly impressed too, praising the ""insurmountable frankness with which she document[ed] the emotional progress of her enslaved soul."" Gippius herself never thought much of the social significance of her published poetry. In a foreword to her debut collection she wrote: ""It is sad to realize that one had to produce something as useless and meaningless as this book. Not that I think poetry to be useless; on the contrary, I am convinced that it is essential, natural and timeless. There were times when poetry was read everywhere and appreciated by everybody. But those times are gone. A modern reader has no use for a book of poetry any more.""
In the early 1900s the Muruzi House acquired the reputation of being one of the Russian capital's new cultural centers. Guests recognized and admired the hostess's authority and her talent for leadership, even if none of them found her particularly warm or affectionate.


=== The New Church ===

In 1899—1901, encouraged by the group of authors associated with Mir Iskusstva, the magazine she had become close to, Gippius published critical essays in it using male pseudonyms, Anton Krainy being the best known. Analyzing the roots of the crisis that Russian culture had fallen into, Gippius (somewhat paradoxically, given her 'demonic' reputation) suggested as a remedy the 'Christianization' of it, which in practice meant bringing the intelligentsia and the Church closer together. Merging faith and intellect, according to Gippius, was crucial for the survival of Russia; only religious ideas, she thought, would bring its people enlightenment and liberation, both sexual and spiritual.
In 1901 Gippius and Merezhkovsky co-founded the Religious and Philosophical Meetings. This 'gathering for free discussion', focusing on the synthesis of culture and religion, brought together an eclectic mix of intellectuals and was regarded in retrospect as an important, if short-lived attempt to pull Russia back from the major social upheavals it was headed for. Gippius was the driving force behind the Meetings, as well as the magazine Novy Put (1903–04), launched initially as a vehicle for the former. By the time Novy Put folded (due to a conflict caused by the newcomer Sergei Bulgakov's refusal to publish her essay on Alexander Blok), Gippius (as Anton Krainy) had become a prominent literary critic, contributing mostly to Vesy (Scales).
After the Meetings were closed in 1903, Gippius tried to revive her initial idea in the form of what was regarded as her 'domestic Church', based on the controversial Troyebratstvo (Brotherhood of Three), composed of herself, Merezhkovsky, and Dmitry Filosofov, their mutual close friend and, for a short while, her lover. This new development outraged many of their friends, like Nikolai Berdyaev who saw this bizarre parody on the Trinity, with its own set of quasi-religious rituals, as profanation bordering on blasphemy.


=== 1905–1917 ===

The 1905 Revolution had a profound impact on Gippius. During the next decade the Merezhkovskys were harsh critics of Tsarism, radical revolutionaries like Boris Savinkov now entering their narrow circle of close friends. In February 1906 the couple left for France to spend more than two years in what they saw as self-imposed exile, trying to introduce Western intellectuals to their 'new religious consciousness'. In 1906 Gippius published the collection of short stories Scarlet Sword (Алый меч), and in 1908 the play Poppie Blossom (Маков цвет) came out, with Merezhkovsky and Filosofov credited as co-authors.
Disappointed with the indifference of European cultural elites to their ideas, the trio returned home. Back in Saint Petersburg Gippius's health deteriorated, and for the next six years she (along with her husband, who had heart problems) regularly visited European health resorts and clinics. During one such voyage in 1911 Gippius bought a cheap apartment in Paris, at Rue Colonel Bonnet, 11-bis. What at the time felt like a casual, unnecessary purchase, later saved them from homelessness abroad.
As the political tension in Russia subsided, the Meetings were re-opened as the Religious and Philosophical Society, in 1908. But Russian Church leaders ignored it, and soon the project withered into a mere literary circle. The heated discussion over the Vekhi manifesto led to a clash between the Merezhkovskys and Filosofov on the one hand and Vasily Rozanov on the other; the latter quit and severed ties with his old friends.
By the time her Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909 came out in 1910, Gippius had become a well-known (though by no means as famous as her husband) European author, translated into German and French. In 1912 her book of short stories Moon Ants (Лунные муравьи) came out, featuring the best prose she had written in years. The two novels, The Demon Dolls (Чортовы куклы, 1911) and Roman-Tsarevich (Роман-царевич, 1912), were meant to be the first and the third book of the Hieromonk Iliodor trilogy, which remained unfinished. The literary left panned them as allegedly 'anti-revolutionary', mainstream critics found these books lackluster, formulaic and tendentious.
At the outbreak of World War I, the Merezhkovskys spoke out against Russia's involvement. Still, Gippius launched a support-the-soldiers campaign of her own, producing a series of frontline-forwarded letters, each combining stylized folk poetic messages with small tobacco-packets, signed with either her own, or one of her three servant maids' names. Some dismissed it as pretentious and meaningless, others applauded what they saw as her reaction to the jingoistic hysteria of the time.


=== 1917–1919 ===
The Merezhkovskys greeted the 1917 February Revolution and denounced the October Revolution, blaming Alexander Kerensky and his Provisional government for the catastrophe. In her book of memoirs Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Him and Us Gippius wrote: Like mice for whom the world amounts to just themselves and cats, and nobody else, those 'revolutionaries' knew but one sort of distinction: that between the left and the right. Kerensky and his kind intrinsically saw themselves as the 'left', regarding their enemies as 'the right'. As the Revolution happened (not 'made' by them), the left triumphed, but – again, like mice in a basement where there are no more cats, they were still wary of the 'right' as the only source of fear, having in sight just one danger that in 1917 there was none of. They weren't afraid of the Bolsheviks – they belonged to the 'left' too. They never believed the Bolsheviks would be able to keep the power they had taken, and failed to notice how the latter, having stolen their slogans, started to use them with ingenuity, speaking of 'land for peasants', 'peace for everybody', 'the Assembly reinstated', republic, freedom and all that...

Gippius saw the October Revolution as the end of Russia and the coming of the Kingdom of Antichrist. ""It felt as if some pillow fell on you to strangle... Strangle what — the city? The country? No, something much, much bigger,"" — she wrote in her 26 October 1917, diary entry. In late 1917 Gippius was still able to publish her anti-Bolshevik verses in what remained of the old newspapers, but the next year was nightmarish, according to her Diaries. Ridiculing H. G. Wells (""I can see why he is so attracted to the Bolsheviks: they’ve leapfrogged him""), she wrote of Cheka atrocities (""In Kiev 1200 officers killed; legs severed, boots taken off."" — 23 February. ""In Rostov teenager cadets shot down — for being mistakenly taken for Constitutional Democratic Party cadets, the banned ones."" — 17 March), of mass hunger and her own growing feeling of dull indifference. ""Those who still have a soul in them walk around like corpses: neither protesting, nor suffering, waiting for nothing, bodies and souls slumped into hunger-induced dormancy.""
Expressing some sympathy for 'the weeping Lunacharsky' (the only Bolshevik leader to express at least some regret concerning the cruelties of the repressive organs), Gippius wrote: ""The things that happen now have nothing to do with Russian history. They will be forgotten, like the atrocities of some savages on a faraway island; will vanish without a trace."" Last Poems (1914–1918), published in 1918, presented a stark and gloomy picture of revolutionary Russia as Gippius saw it. After the defeats of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia and Anton Denikin in Southern Russia, respectively, the Merezhkovskys moved to Petrograd. In late 1919, invited to join a group of 'red professors' in Crimea, Gippius chose not to, having heard of massacres orchestrated by local chiefs Béla Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka. Having obtained permission to leave the city (the pretext being that they would head for the frontlines, with lectures on Ancient Egypt for Red Army fighters), Merezhkovsky and Gippius, as well as her secretary Vladimir Zlobin and Dmitry Filosofov, departed to Poland by train.


=== Gippius in exile ===

Their first destination was Minsk where Merezhkovsky and Gippius gave a series of lectures for Russian immigrants and published political pamphlets in the Minsk Courier. During a stay of several months in Warsaw Gippius edited the Svoboda newspaper. Disillusioned with Jozef Pilsudski's policies, the Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France on 20 October without Filosofov, who chose to stay in the city with Boris Savinkov. The Merezhkovskys's relocation to France was facilitated by Olga and Eugene Petit, who also helped them secure entry and residence permit for their friends such as Ivan Manukhin.
In Paris Gippius concentrated on making appointments, sorting out mail, negotiating contracts and receiving guests. The Merezhkovsky's talks, as Nina Berberova remembered, always revolved around two major themes: Russia and freedom. Backing Merezhkovsky in his anti-Bolshevik crusade, she was deeply pessimistic as regards what her husband referred to as his 'mission'. ""Our slavery is so unheard of and our revelations are so outlandish that for a free man it is difficult to understand what we are talking about,"" she conceded.
The tragedy of the exiled Russian writer became a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore mystical and covertly sexual themes. She remained a harsh literary critic and, by dismissing many of the well-known writers of the Symbolist and Acmeist camps, made herself an unpopular figure in France.
In the early 1920s several of Gippius's earlier works were re-issued in the West, including the collection of stories Heavenly Words (Небесные слова, 1921, Paris) and the Poems. 1911–1912 Diary (1922, Berlin). In Munich The Kingdom of Antichrist (Царство Антихриста), authored by Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov, and Zlobin, came out, including the first two parts of Gippius's Petersburg Diaries (Петербургские дневники). Gippius was the major force behind the Green Lamp (Зелёная лампа) society, named after the 19th century group associated with Alexander Pushkin. Factional altercations aside, it proved to be the only cultural center where Russian émigré writers and philosophers (carefully chosen for each meeting and invited personally) could meet and discuss political and cultural topics.
In 1928 the Merezhkovskys took part in the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade. Encouraged by the success of Merezhkovsky's Da Vinci series of lectures and Benito Mussolini's benevolence, in 1933 the couple moved to Italy where they stayed for about three years, visiting Paris only occasionally. With the Socialist movement rising there and anti-Russian emigration feelings spurred by President Paul Doumer's murder in 1932, France felt like a hostile place to them. Living in exile was very hard for Gippius psychologically. As one biographer put it, ""her metaphysically grandiose personality, with its spiritual and intellectual overload, was out of place in what she herself saw as a 'soullessly pragmatic' period in European history.""


==== The last years ====
As the outbreak of World War II in Europe rendered literature virtually irrelevant, Gippius, against all odds, compiled and published the Literature Tornado, an ambitious literary project set up to provide a safe haven for writers rejected by publishers for ideological reasons. What in other times might have been hailed as a powerful act in support of the freedom of speech, in 1939 passed unnoticed. Merezhkovsky and Gippius spent their last year together in a social vacuum. Regardless of whether or not the 1944 text of Merezhkovsky's allegedly pro-Hitler ""Radio speech"" was indeed a prefabricated montage (as his biographer Zobnin asserted), there was little doubt that the couple, having become too close to (and financially dependent on) the Germans in Paris, had lost respect and credibility as far as their compatriots were concerned, many of whom expressed outright hatred toward them.
Merezhkovsky's death in 1941 came as a heavy blow to Gippius. After the deaths of Dmitry Filosofov and her sister Anna (in 1940 and 1942 respectively) she found herself alone in the world and, as some sources suggest, contemplated suicide. With her secretary Vladimir Zlobin still around, though, Gippius resorted to writing what she hoped would some day gel into the comprehensive life story of her late husband. As Teffi remembered, 

 Gippius spent the last months of her life working, mostly at nights. Filling one journal after another with that fine calligraphic handwriting of hers, she was preparing a major book that was to become, as she saw it, a proper tribute to her lifetime companion, the one she referred to as 'the Great Man'. She praised this man in terms which were most unusual for her – a woman of icy sharp intellect whose view on people around her was so utterly ironic. She must have loved him very, very strongly.
Gippius died on 9 September 1945. Her last written words were: ""Low is my price.... And wise is God."" She was interred in Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery with her husband. A small group of people attended the ceremony, among them Ivan Bunin.


== Legacy ==

Modern scholars see Gippius's romantically tinged early poems as mostly derivative, Semyon Nadson and Friedrich Nietzsche being the two most obvious influences. The publication of Dmitry Merezhkovsky's symbolist manifesto proved to be a turning point: in a short time Gippius became a major figure of Russian Modernism. Her early symbolist prose carried the strong influence of Dostoyevsky, while one of her later novels, Roman Tzarevich (1912), was said to be influenced again by Nietzsche. Gippius's first two short story collections, New People (1896) and Mirrors (1898), examining ""the nature of beauty in all of its manifestations and contradictions,"" were seen as formulaic. Her Third Book of Short Stories (1902) marked a change of direction and was described as ""sickly idiosyncratic"" and full of ""highbrow mysticism."" Parallels have been drawn between Gippius's early 20th century prose and Vladimir Solovyov's Meaning of Love, both authors examining the 'quest for love' as the means for self-fulfillment of the human soul.
It was not prose but poetry that made Gippius a major innovative force. ""Gippius the poet holds her own special place in Russian literature; her poems are deeply intellectual, immaculate in form, and genuinely exciting."" Critics praised her originality and technical virtuosity, claiming her to be a ""true heir to Yevgeny Baratynsky's muse"".
Her Collection of Poems. 1889–1903 became an important event in Russian cultural life. Having defined the world of poetry as a three-dimensional structure involving ""Love and Eternity meeting in Death"", she discovered and explored in it her own brand of ethic and aesthetic minimalism. Symbolist writers were the first to praise her 'hint and pause' metaphor technique, as well as the art of ""extracting sonorous chords out of silent pianos,"" according to Innokenty Annensky, who saw the book as the artistic peak of ""Russia's 15 years of modernism"" and argued that ""not a single man would ever be able to dress abstractions in clothes of such charm [as this woman]."" Men admired Gippius's outspokenness too: Gippius commented on her inner conflicts, full of 'demonic temptations' (inevitable for a poet whose mission was 'creating a new, true soul', as she put it), with unusual frankness.
The 1906 collection Scarlet Sword, described as a study in the 'human soul's metaphysics' performed from the neo-Christian standpoint, propagated the idea of God and man as one single being. The author equated 'self-denial' with the sin of betraying God, and detractors suspected blasphemy in this egocentric stance. Sex and death themes, investigated in the obliquely impressionist manner formed the leitmotif of her next book of prose, Black on White (1908). The 20th century also saw the rise of Gippius the playwright (Saintly Blood, 1900, Poppie Blossom, 1908). The most acclaimed of her plays, The Green Ring (1916), futuristic in plotline, if not in form, was successfully produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold for the Alexandrinsky Theatre. Anton Krainy, Gippius's alter ego, was a highly respected and somewhat feared literary critic whose articles regularly appeared in Novy Put, Vesy and Russkaya Mysl. Gippius's critical analysis, according to Brockhaus and Efron, was insightful, but occasionally too harsh and rarely objective.

The 1910 Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909 garnered good reviews; Bunin called Gippius's poetry 'electric', pointing at the peculiar use of oxymoron as an electrifying force in the author's hermetic, impassive world. Some contemporaries found Gippius's works curiously unfeminine. Vladislav Khodasevich spoke of the conflict between her ""poetic soul and non-poetic mind."" ""Everything is strong and spatial in her verse, there is little room for details. Her lively, sharp thought, dressed in emotional complexity, sort of rushes out of her poems, looking for spiritual wholesomeness and ideal harmony,"" modern scholar Vitaly Orlov said.
Gippius's novels The Devil's Doll (1911) and Roman Tzarevich (1912), aiming to ""lay bare the roots of Russian reactionary ideas,"" were unsuccessful: critics found them tendentious and artistically inferior. ""In poetry Gippius is more original than in prose. Well constructed, full of intriguing ideas, never short of insight, her stories and novellas are always a bit too preposterous, stiff and uninspired, showing little knowledge of real life. Gippius's characters pronounce interesting words and find themselves in interestingly difficult situations but fail to turn into living people in the reader's mind. Serving as embodiments of ideas and concepts, they are genuinely crafted marionettes put into action by the author's hand, not by their own inner motives.""
The events of October 1917 led to Gippius severing all ties with most of those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs The Living Faces (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity ""leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf."" Behind all this, for Gippius, there was a kind of 'monumental madness'; it was all the more important for her to keep a ""healthy mind and strong memory,"" she explained.
After Last Poems (1918) Gippius published two more books of verse, Poems. 1911–1920 Diaries (1922) and The Shining Ones (1938). Her poetry, prose and essays published in emigration were utterly pessimistic; the 'rule of beastliness', the ruins of human culture, and the demise of civilization were her major themes. Most valuable for Gippius were her diaries: she saw these flash points of personal history as essential for helping future generations to restore the true course of events. Yet, as a modern Russian critic has put it, ""Gippius's legacy, for all its inner drama and antinomy, its passionate, forceful longing for the unfathomable, has always borne the ray of hope, the fiery, unquenchable belief in a higher truth and the ultimate harmony crowning a person's destiny. As she herself wrote in one of her last poems, ""Alas, now they are torn apart: the timelessness and all things human / But time will come and both will intertwine into one shimmering eternity'.""

Pentina,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Pentina,genus,wikipedia.org,"The pentina is an accentual-syllabic poetic form, characterized by the use of five verses of five lines each, with a two-line envoi, for a total of 27 lines.  It is similar to the French form, the sestina, which is characterized by six verses of six lines each, with a final 3-line envoi.  Its creation in 1995 by American poet and songwriter Leigh Harrison was documented in an article, ""The Joys of the Pentina"" (Medicinal Purposes Literary Review, Vol. II, No. XII, published in 2005).  The Pentina form is also described in Lewis Turco's ""The Book of Forms / Odd and Invented Forms"" which was published in 2011 in the U.S.
The pentina, like the sestina, does not utilize rhyme, but relies on the use of repeated end-words (properly called ""teleutons""), picked up and re-used in each succeeding stanza, with variations in the order.  The repeating pattern of the teleutons, as with those of the sestina, have no mathematical or numerical significance, but they have a spatial logic: bottom end-word, top end-word, one word up from bottom, one word up from top, middle end-word. The final two-line envoi uses the repeated end-words so that either two are in the first, and three in the third, or three in the first and two in the third, with the poet choosing the preferred style. The set pattern of the repeated teleutons works as follows:
Verse 1: a b c d e
Verse 2: e a d b c
Verse 3: c e b a d
Verse 4: d c a e b
Verse 5: b d e c a
Envoi:  

 a  b  c    
    d  e

It is a widely spread species that has been distributed by commerce over much of the warmer parts of Africa, Eurasia, Malaysia, Australia, many Pacific islands and North and South America.
The wingspan is 9–22 mm. Adults are brown and speckled with dark brown or black.
The larvae feed on dried goods, cereals, grain, rice, nuts, seeds and other dry vegetable matter. It is a pest of dried tobacco leaves in some regions and it has been reported as a pest of dried insect specimens. Full-grown larvae are about 17 mm long, cylindrical, dirty white and skin transparent. The head is red brown.
The larva pupates in a closely woven and smooth cocoon within a loosely spun outer framework or outer cocoon, to which particles of food and excrement adhere.

Neococytius,genus,wikipedia.org,"Neococytius is a monotypic moth genus in the family Sphingidae erected by Ronald W. Hodges in 1971. Its only species, Neococytius cluentius, the Cluentius sphinx, was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1775 as Sphinx cluentius. It is found in northern South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. It is rare on Cuba. It has been recorded in North America, from Mississippi north to Michigan and Illinois.
The wingspan is 140–160 mm. There are at least three generations in the tropics, with adults on wing from December to January, May to June (or July in Jamaica) and October.
The larvae have been recorded on Annonaceae and Piperaceae species as well as Ipomoea batatas.
Otto Porsch in 1939 discussed the potential role of the species (under the synonym Cocytius cluentius) in pollinating cacti, giving the length of its tongue as 25 cm, and noting the corresponding lengths of the flowers of night-blooming cacti. A discussion of the possible pollinators of the cactus Strophocactus wittii in 1997 used the species name Cocytius ""cruentus""; however, it cited a source that uses the correct specific name cluentius.

Gamelia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Gamelia,genus,wikipedia.org,"The term gamelia (Γαμηλία) can refer to several ancient Athenian customs revolving around the act of marriage. Most often it relates to the practice in which a new husband would perform an offering in honor of his recent marriage for his phratry during the Apaturia.


== Citizenship and the Apaturia ==
Taking place during the three-day festival in the month of Pyanepsion, the gamelia was a part of a series of initiatory rituals revolving around the phratries. It was a way to secure public recognition of a marriage, as it introduced the new union to the phratry while also signaling a change in status and lifestyle for the groom to the group.
The ritual likely became very significant after 451/450 when Pericles' new citizenship laws were enacted: these asserted that both parents had to be of Athenian origin in order for a child to be deemed ""legitimate"", thus getting full political rights of citizenship through admittance to a phratry and deme. Prior to Pericles' law, only the father or adoptive father of the inductee had to be Athenian. Phratry membership revolved around the idea of kinship linked through a common male ancestral line: the fathers had to be free Athenian citizens with membership in order for the sons to be inducted. Following 451, citizenship was more restrictive: Without Athenian origin on both sides, young men would not be considered astoi and eligible for participation in Athenian political life. Rather, any children born of a union not between two Athenians could be considered nothoi, meaning bastards, or metics, and excluded from the full rights of citizenship. Pericles' law raised the stakes, elevating engyetic marriage in pursuit of ""legitimate"" Athenian heirs.
The gamelia was a way to prove the status of the mother, as this ritual was essentially an act of introduction to the phratry. If the legitimacy of a son was ever contested on the grounds of parentage, the young man could point to the celebration of his parents' gamelia in the memory of the phratores, signifying they were both true Athenian. It was probably practiced prior to 451/450, but it took on new importance with increasingly restrictive Athenian citizenship laws.
This is seen in the literature of the period, such as in Demosthenes 57, where Euxitheos calls upon phratry members who witnessed his father's gamelia, celebrated on his mother's behalf, to prove his legitimacy. A level of scrutiny was common to the admittance practices of the Koureotis, the final day of the Apaturia in which young men are formally inducted. In the phratry of Apollodoros of Leukonion, for example, the sponsor would have to swear on the sacrificial victim that the candidate was the son of true Athenian citizens. Oaths and the presentation of members such as this were commonplace, functioning to ensure that only ""true"" Athenians could be endowed with full citizenship rights.


== In practice ==
In regard to the specific practice of gamelia, it appears to have been both an offering of wine and food as a feast for fellow members as well as an accompanying sacrifice. An account is portrayed in Aristophanes' Peace, where Trygaios brings a ram to be sacrificed in celebration of his new bride. Trygaios also adds includes certain food in the banquet, such as bread and some game, which are assumed to be typical gamelia offerings (cf. the darata of the Labyadai, CID I).
It is unclear whether all phratries required gamelia following marriage, as nomoi differed depending on the phratry. For the phratry of Pyrrhos, for example, gamelia was expressly required, written down in a nomos.  This suggests that perhaps not all phratries demanded gamelia to follow the marriages of their members, but the benefits made it a popular custom: like the registration of the infant's name, it would be future insurance of the child's political and inheritance rights. Given the death of the parents, or rumors of a future affair, the recognition of the marriage by the phratry would prove instrumental. Another unclear aspect of the ritual is whether or not the brides themselves were actually present: given the nature of the male-oriented phratry, they probably would have remained on the margins of the group, rather than playing a central role. Although there is no consensus, some scholars point to another feast, the gamoi, as one which included women; the contrasting depiction of the two in literature points to the conclusion that the gamelia was an all-male celebration for just the phratry.
It also appears that for Athenians of lower socio-economic classes, weddings and gamelia could be celebrated together. This is possible if the families involved lived close by where the phratry traditionally met, cutting down on travel and festival costs for both parties by hosting it alongside the Apaturia. This would still allow for the procession, an important and symbolic crux of the gamos where the bride is taken to the home of her new husband, to take place. Middle and upper-class families, however, most likely held the ceremonies separately. The temporal distance allowed for more of a focus on the gamos itself, rather than the activities of the phratry. It also meant a separate occasion for celebration in their own homes, where they could exhibit status and hospitality more openly.
In fact, most weddings were held during the month of Gamelion, our months of January and February. Fittingly, the Apaturia occurred nine months after: This was based on the notion that a child would be conceived soon following marriage, and at the Apaturia he would then be registered in his father's phratry as a newborn. Evidently the timing of childbirth did not always work out this way, and infants would just be registered at the Apaturia the following year.


== Wedding day uses ==
The term gamelia took on other meanings outside of the Apaturia festival, also relating to a ritual on the eve of the gamos or wedding day. The bride-to-be was led to the Acropolis of Athens to the temple of Athena by her parents; there, under the watch of the priestess of Athena Polias, a series of proteleia or preliminary sacrifices took place. These would be animal sacrifices as well as fruit offerings, and several other deities would be honored in the following proteleia. Zeus, Hera, Aphrodite, Peitho, and Artemis were all sacrificed to as well in the hope that they would protect and preside over the marriage. Chief among these was Hera Gamelia, the cult epithet meaning Hera of the Wedding, and as a group they were referred to as the Gamellii gods.

Arias,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Arias,genus,wikipedia.org,"In music, an aria (, Italian: [ˈaːrja]; pl.: arie, Italian: [ˈaːrje]; arias in common usage; diminutive form: arietta, Italian: [aˈrjetta]; pl.: ariette; in English simply air) is a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work.
The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, or they can be stand-alone concert arias. The term was originally used to refer to any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer.


== Etymology ==
The Italian term aria, which derives from the Greek ἀήρ and Latin aer (air), first appeared in relation to music in the 14th century when it simply signified a manner or style of singing or playing. By the end of the 16th century, the term 'aria' refers to an instrumental form (cf. Santino Garsi da Parma lute works, ('Aria del Gran Duca'). By the early 16th century, it was in common use as meaning a simple setting of strophic poetry; melodic madrigals, free of complex polyphony, were known as madrigale arioso.


== In opera ==


=== Aria form in late 17th century French and Italian opera ===
In the context of staged works and concert works, arias evolved from simple melodies into structured forms. In such works, the sung, melodic, and structured aria differed from the speech-like (parlando) recitative – the latter tending to carry the story-line, the former used to convey emotional content and serve as an opportunity for singers to display their vocal talent.
By the late 17th century, operatic arias came to be written in one of two forms. Binary form arias were in two sections (A–B); arias in ternary form (A–B–A) were known as da capo arias (literally 'from the head', i.e. with the opening section repeated, often in a highly decorated manner). In the da capo aria, the 'B' episode would typically be in a different key – the dominant or relative major key. Other variants of these forms are found in the French operas of the late 17th century such as those of Jean-Baptiste Lully which dominated the period of the French baroque. Vocal solos in his operas (known of course as the French term, airs) are frequently in extended binary form (ABB') or sometimes in rondeau form (ABACA), (a shape which is analogous to the instrumental rondo).
In the work of Italian composers of the late 17th and early 18th century, the da capo aria came to be include the ritornello (literally, 'little return'), a recurring instrumental episode which featured certain phrases of the aria proper and provided, in early operas, the opportunity for dancing or entries of characters. Da capo aria with ritornelli became a typifying feature of European opera throughout the 18th century and is thought by some writers to be a direct antecedent of sonata form. The ritornelli became essential to the structure of the aria – ""while the words determine the character of a melody the ritornello instruments often decided in what terms it shall be presented.""


=== 18th century ===
By the early 18th century, composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti had established the aria form, and especially its da capo version with ritornelli, as the key element of opera seria. ""It offered balance and continuity, and yet gave scope for contrast. [...] The very regularity of its conventional features enabled deviations from the normal to be exploited with telling effect."" In the early years of the century, arias in the Italian style began to take over in French opera, giving rise eventually to the French genre of ariette, normally in a relatively simple ternary form.
Types of operatic aria became known by a variety of terms according to their character – e.g.aria parlante  ('speaking-style', narrative in nature), aria di bravura (typically given to a heroine), aria buffa (aria of a comic type, typically given to a bass or bass-baritone), and so on.
M. F. Robinson describes the standard aria in opera seria in the period 1720 to 1760 as follows:

The first section normally began with an orchestral ritornello after which the singer entered and sang the words of the first stanza in their entirety. By the end of this first vocal paragraph the music, if it were in a major key as it usually was, had modulated to the dominant. The orchestra then played a second ritornello usually shorter than the first. The singer re-entered and sang the same words through a second time. The music of this second paragraph was often slightly more elaborate than that of the first. There were more repeats of words and perhaps more florid vocalisations. The key worked its way back to the tonic for the final vocal cadence after which the orchestra rounded the section off with a final ritornello.

The nature and allocation of the arias to the different roles in opera seria was highly formalized. According to the playwright and librettist Carlo Goldoni, in his autobiography,

The three principal personages of the drama ought to sing five arias each; two in the first act, two in the second, and one in the third. The second actress and the second soprano can only have three, and the inferior characters must be satisfied with a single aria each, or two at the most. The author of the words must [...] take care that two pathetic [i.e. melancholy] arias do not succeed one another. He must distribute with the same precaution the bravura arias, the arias of action, the inferior arias, and the minuets and rondeaus. He must, above all things, avoid giving impassioned arias, bravura arias, or rondeaus, to inferior characters.
By contrast, arias in opera buffa (comic opera) were often specific in character to the nature of the character being portrayed (for example the cheeky servant-girl or the irascible elderly suitor or guardian).
By later in the century it was clear that these formats were becoming fossilized. Christoph Willibald Gluck thought that both opera buffa and opera seria had strayed too far from what opera should really be, and seemed unnatural. The jokes of opera buffa were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and stale. As in opera buffa, the singers were often masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance. The effects of these Gluckist reforms were seen not only in his own operas but in the later works of Mozart; the arias now become far more expressive of the individual emotions of the characters and are both more firmly anchored in, and advance, the storyline. Richard Wagner was to praise Gluck's innovations in his 1850 essay ""Opera and Drama"": "" The musical composer revolted against the wilfulness of the singer""; rather than ""unfold[ing] the purely sensuous contents of the Aria to their highest, rankest, pitch"", Gluck sought ""to put shackles on Caprice's execution of that Aria, by himself endeavouring to give the tune [...] an expression answering to the underlying Word-text"". This attitude was to underlie Wagner's would-be deconstruction of aria in his concept of Gesamtkunstwerk.


=== 19th century ===
Despite the ideals of Gluck, and the trend to organise libretti so that arias had a more organic part in the drama rather than merely interrupting its flow, in the operas of the early 19th century, (for example those of Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti), bravura arias remained focal attractions, and they continued to play a major role in grand opera, and in Italian opera through the 19th century.
A favoured form of aria in the first half of the 19th century in Italian opera was the cabaletta, in which a songlike cantabile section is followed by a more animated section, the cabaletta proper, repeated in whole or in part. Typically such arias would be preceded by recitative, the whole sequence being termed a scena. There might also be opportunities for participation by orchestra or chorus. An example is Casta diva from the opera Norma of Vincenzo Bellini.
After around 1850, aria forms in Italian opera began to show more variety – many of the operas of Giuseppe Verdi offer extended narrative arias for leading roles that enable, in their scope, intensification of drama and characterisation. Examples include Rigoletto's condemnation of the court, ""Cortigiani, vil razza dannata!"" (1851).
Later in the century, the post-1850 operas of Wagner were through-composed, with fewer elements being readily identifiable as self-contained arias; whilst the Italian genre of verismo opera also sought to integrate arioso elements although still allowing some 'show-pieces'.


== Concert arias ==
Concert arias, which are not part of any larger work, (or were sometimes written to replace or insert arias in their own operas or operas of other composers) were written by composers to provide the opportunity for vocal display for concert singers; examples are Ah! perfido, Op. 65, by Beethoven, and a number of concert arias by Mozart, including Conservati fedele.


== Instrumental music ==

The term 'aria' was frequently used in the 17th and 18th centuries for instrumental music modelled on vocal music. For example, J. S. Bach's so-called ""Goldberg Variations"" were titled at their 1741 publication ""Clavier Ubung bestehend in einer ARIA mit verschiedenen Verænderungen"" (""Keyboard exercise, consisting of one ARIA with diverse variations."")
The word is sometimes used in contemporary music as a title for instrumental pieces, e.g. Robin Holloway's 1980 'aria' for chamber ensemble or Harrison Birtwistle's brass band piece, ""Grimethorpe Aria"" (1973).

Carmenta,genus,wikipedia.org,"In ancient Roman religion and myth, Carmenta (Greek) or Carmentis (Latin) was a goddess of childbirth and prophecy, associated with technological innovation  as well as the protection of mothers and children and a patron of midwives. She was also said to have invented the Latin alphabet.


== Background ==

The name Carmenta is derived from Latin carmen, meaning a magic spell, oracle or song, and also the root of the English word charm. Her original name was Nicostrate (Greek: Νικοστράτη, ""victory-army""), but it was changed later to honor her renown for giving oracles (Latin singular: carmen). She was the mother of Evander of Pallene (fathered by Hermes) and, along with other Greek followers, they founded the town of Pallantium which later was one of the sites of the start of Rome. Gaius Julius Hyginus (Fab. 277) mentions the legend that it was she who altered fifteen letters of the Greek alphabet to become the Latin alphabet which her son Evander introduced into Latium.
Carmenta was one of the Camenae and the Cimmerian Sibyl. The leader of her cult was called the flamen carmentalis.
It was forbidden to wear leather or other forms of dead skin in her temple which was next to the Porta Carmentalis, and close to the Theater of Marcellus in Rome. Her festival, called the Carmentalia, was celebrated primarily by women on January 11 and January 15. She is remembered in De Mulieribus Claris, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 1361–62. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

Alcathoe,genus,wikipedia.org,"The Minyades (Ancient Greek: Μινυάδες) were three Orchomenian (Arcadian) princesses in Greek mythology. These sisters were protagonists of a myth about the perils of neglecting the worship of Dionysus. 


== Names and family ==
The names of the Minyades were Alcathoe (or Alcithoe), Leucippe and Arsippe (although instead of ""Arsippe"", Claudius Aelianus calls the latter ""Aristippa"", and Plutarch ""Arsinoë""; Ovid uses ""Leuconoe"" instead of ""Leucippe""). They were daughters of Minyas, king of Orchomenus, Boeotia.


== Mythology ==

At the time when the worship of Dionysus was introduced into Boeotia, and while the other women and maidens were reveling and ranging over the mountains in Bacchic joy, these sisters alone remained at home, devoting themselves to their usual occupations, and thus profaning the days sacred to the god.  Dionysus punished them by changing them into bats, and their work into vines. Plutarch, Aelian, and Antoninus Liberalis, though with some differences in the detail, relate that Dionysus appeared to the sisters in the form of a maiden, and invited them to partake in the Dionysian Mysteries.  When the sisters declined the invitation, the god metamorphosed himself successively into a bull, a lion, and a panther, and the sisters were driven mad.
In this state of madness, they were eager to honor the god, and Leucippe, who was chosen by lot to offer a sacrifice to Dionysus, gave up her own son Hippasus, whom the sisters tore to pieces.  The sisters afterwards roamed over the mountains in a frenzy, until at last Hermes changed them into bats.  Plutarch adds that down to his time the men of Orchomenus descended from that family were called psoloeis (ψολόεις), that is, mourners, and the women oleiai or aioleiai (ὀλεῖαι or αἰολεῖαι), that is, the destroyers.


=== Antoninus' account ===
Another retelling of the wrathful punishment of the Minyades by the god Dionysus appeared in Antoninus Liberalis' Metamorphoses:The daughters of Minyas, son of Orchomenus, were Leucippe, Arsippe and Alcathoe. They turned out to be startlingly diligent. They strongly criticized other women because they abandoned the city to go as Bacchantes in the hills until Dionysus took on the likeness of a girl and urged the Minyades not to miss out on the rites or mysteries of the god. But they paid no heed to him. At this—not surprisingly—Dionysus was angered and instead of a girl became a bull, then a lion, then a leopard. From the beams of their looms there flowed for him milk and nectar.At these portents, terror gripped the maidens. Without delay, the three threw lots into a pot and shook it. The lot fell to Leucippe and she vowed to offer as a sacrifice to the god her own son Hippasus whom she tore to pieces with the help of her sisters. Abandoning their paternal home, they went as Bacchantes in the mountains, browsing on ivy, honeysuckle, and laurel, until Hermes touched them with his wand and changed them into flying creatures. One of them became a bat, another an owl and the third an eagle owl. And all three continuously avoided the light of  the sun.

Enyo,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Enyo,genus,wikipedia.org,"Enyo is called the ""sister of War"" (in Greek Polemos) by Quintus Smyrnaeus, in a role closely resembling that of Eris, the embodiment of strife and discord, with Homer, in particular, representing the two as the same. In some myths, she is identified as the mother of the war god Enyalius as well, and in these myths, Ares is indicated as the father, however, the masculine name Enyalius or Enyalios also may be used as a title for Ares.
As goddess of war, Enyo is responsible for orchestrating the destruction of cities, often accompanying Ares into battle. She is depicted as ""supreme in war"". She is so delighted in warfare that she even refused to take sides in the battle between Zeus and the monster Typhon:

Eris (Strife) was Typhon's escort in the mellee, Nike (Victory) led Zeus into battle… impartial Enyo held equal balance between the two sides, between Zeus and Typhon, while the thunderbolts with booming shots revel like dancers in the sky.
Enyo was involved in the war of the Seven against Thebes, and in Dionysus's war with the Indians as well. During the fall of Troy, Enyo inflicted terror and bloodshed in the war, along with Eris (""Strife""), Phobos (""Fear""), and Deimos (""Dread""), the latter two being sons of Ares. She, Eris, and the two sons of Ares are depicted on the shield of Achilles.",1312

Psamathia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Samatya (Greek: Ψαμάθεια, romanized: Psamatheia; Armenian: Սամաթիա) is a quarter of the Fatih district of Istanbul. It is located along the Marmara Sea, and borders to the west on the neighborhood of Yedikule (the ""Castle of the Seven Towers""). 


== Etymology ==
The name originates from the Greek word psamathion (Ψαμάθιον), meaning ""sandy"", because of the great quantity of sand found in the quarter. 


== History ==
About 383 AD, the first monastic institution was established in Constantinople, at Psamatheia, at that time still outside the walled city.
Up to recent times, Samatya was mostly inhabited by Armenians, who were settled here in 1458 by Sultan Mehmet II, and who own there the church of Surp Kevork, also called Sulu Manastiri (Water's monastery) – previously an Eastern Orthodox church which dates back to before the Ottoman conquest, and by Greeks, who have the churches of Hristos Analipsis and Haghios Menas.
The quarter was destroyed in 1782 by one of the largest fires of Istanbul ever recorded.
The area was affected by the British bombing of İstanbul during the WWI.


== Samatya today ==
In Samatya there is also an important public hospital, the Istanbul Educational and Research Hospital İstanbul Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi.
Samatya has a station (named ""Kocamustafapaşa"") on the T6 line Sirkeci-Kazlıçeşme.

Urania,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Urania,genus,wikipedia.org,"Urania ( yoor-AY-nee-ə; Ancient Greek: Οὐρανία, romanized: Ouranía; modern Greek shortened name Ράνια Ránia; meaning ""heavenly"" or ""of heaven"") was, in Greek mythology, the muse of astronomy and astrology. Urania is the goddess of astronomy and stars, her attributes being the globe and compass.
The muse Urania is sometimes confused with Aphrodite Urania (""heavenly Aphrodite"") because of their similar name.


== Family ==
Urania was the daughter of Zeus by Mnemosyne and also a great-granddaughter of Uranus. Some accounts list her as the mother of the musician Linus by Apollo or Hermes or Amphimarus, son of Poseidon. Hymenaeus is also said to have been a son of Urania.


== Function and representation ==

Urania is often associated with Universal Love. Sometimes identified as the eldest of the divine sisters, Urania inherited Zeus' majesty and power and the beauty and grace of her mother Mnemosyne.
Urania dresses in a cloak embroidered with stars and keeps her eyes and attention focused on the Heavens. She is usually represented with a celestial globe to which she points with a little staff, and depicted in modern art with stars above her head. She is able to foretell the future by the arrangement of the stars.


== Urania as Muse ==

Those who are most concerned with philosophy and the heavens are dearest to her. Those who have been instructed by her she raises aloft to heaven, for it is a fact that imagination and the power of thought lift men's souls to heavenly heights.Urania, o'er her star-bespangled lyre,With touch of majesty diffused her soul;A thousand tones, that in the breast inspire,Exalted feelings, o er the wires'gan roll—How at the call of Jove the mist unfurled,And o'er the swelling vault—the glowing sky,The new-born stars hung out their lamps on high,And rolled their mighty orbs to music's sweetest sound.—From An Ode To Music by James G. PercivalDuring the Renaissance, Urania began to be considered the Muse for Christian poets. In the invocation to Book 7 of John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, the poet invokes Urania to aid his narration of the creation of the cosmos, though he cautions that it is ""[t]he meaning, not the name I call"" (7.5)


== In popular culture ==


=== Urania in Astronomy and Navigation ===
The planet Uranus, though mostly named after the Greek god personifying the sky, is also indirectly named after Urania.
Urania is the namesake for astronomical observatories in Berlin, Budapest, Bucharest, Vienna, Zürich, Antwerp, and Uraniborg on the island of Hven. The main belt asteroid (30) Urania was also named after her.
The official seal of the U.S. Naval Observatory portrays Urania. Hr. Ms. Urania is a sail training vessel for the Royal Netherlands Naval College. There has been a Hr. Ms. Urania in the Royal Netherlands Navy since 1832.
Urania is featured on the seal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, as well of its motto: Quo ducit Urania (""Where Urania leads"").


=== Other uses of ""Urania"" ===
Urania is the name traditionally given to the eighth book of Herodotus' Histories.
Aphrodite Urania (heavenly Aphrodite) is often an epithet given to Aphrodite in contrast with her more earthy aspect Aphrodite Pandemos (Aphrodite for all people).]
Urania is the muse for books 7 and 9  of Paradise Lost.

Sparganocosma,genus,wikipedia.org,"Sparganocosma is a genus of moths in the family Tortricidae. It contains only one species, Sparganocosma docsturnerorum, which is found in north-western Costa Rica.

The length of the forewings is 8.8–11 mm for males and 10.5–13 mm for females. The forewings have two large ovoid patches of pale buff in the costal region. These patches are infrequently separated by a narrow brown remnant of a median fascia. The patches usually have small flecks of brown. The remainder of the wing has a broad brown longitudinal band along the dorsum. The hindwings are rather uniformly dark grey brown. They are slightly darker in females.
The larvae have been recorded feeding on Asplundia utilis and Asplundia microphylla. They are pale translucent yellow gold with a nearly uniformly amber head.


== Etymology ==
The genus name is derived from Latin spargano (meaning to scatter or throw around) and cosm (referring to the universe). The species is named in honour of Drs. John Turner and Nancy Turner, who psychologically and financially supported the Lepidoptera inventory of Área de Conservación in Costa Rica.

All platynotans have a hinged upper jaw with widely spaced teeth, each having a large base, that erupt from behind existing teeth. The teeth are plicidentine, meaning that they have highly folded layers of dentine in their centers. Many have fused frontal and nasal bones on the top of their skulls (in other lizards, these bones are separated into pairs). Some platynotan features that are not seen in the skeleton, and therefore only known from living species, include a deeply forked tongue and a venom gland called the gland of Gabe.",658

Bactra,genus,wikipedia.org,"At the time of the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century, however, Balkh had provided an outpost of resistance and a safe haven for the Persian emperor Yazdegerd III who fled there from the armies of Umar. Later, in the 9th century, during the reign of Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar, Islam became firmly rooted in the local population.Arabs occupied Persia in 642 (during the Caliphate of Uthman, 644–656 AD). Attracted by the grandeur and wealth of Balkh, they attacked it in 645 AD. It was only in 653 when Arab commander al-Ahnaf raided the town again and compelled it to pay tribute. The Arab hold over the town, however, remained tenuous. The area was brought under Arab control only after it was reconquered by Muawiya in 663 AD. Prof. Upasak describes the effect of this conquest in these words: ""The Arabs plundered the town and killed the people indiscriminately. It is said that they raided the famous Buddhist shrine of Nava-Vihara, which the Arab historians call 'Nava Bahara' and describe it as one of the magnificent places, which comprised a range of 360 cells around the high stupas'. They plundered the gems and jewels that were studded on many images and stupas and took away the wealth accumulated in the Vihara but probably did no considerable harm to other monastic buildings or to the monks residing there"".
The Arab attacks had little effect on the normal ecclesiastical life in the monasteries or Balkh Buddhist population outside. Buddhism continued to flourish with their monasteries as the centres of Buddhist learning and training. Scholars, monks and pilgrims from China, India and Korea continued to visit this place. Several revolts were made against the Arab rule in Balkh.
The Arabs' control over Balkh did not last long as it soon came under the rule of a local prince, a zealous Buddhist called Nazak (or Nizak) Tarkhan. He expelled the Arabs from his territories in 670 or 671. He is said to have not only reprimanded the Chief Priest (Barmak) of Nava-Vihara but beheaded him for embracing Islam. As per another account, when Balkh was conquered by the Arabs, the head priest of the Nava-Vihara had gone to the capital and became a Muslim. This displeased the people of the Balkh. He was deposed and his son was placed in his position.
Nazak Tarkhan is also said to have murdered not only the Chief Priest but also his sons. Only a young son was saved. He was taken by his mother to Kashmir where he was given training in medicine, astronomy and other sciences. Later they returned to Balkh. Prof. Maqbool Ahmed observes ""One is tempted to think that the family originated from Kashmir, for in time of distress, they took refuge in the Valley. Whatever it be, their Kashmiri origin is undoubted and this also explains the deep interest of the Barmaks, in later years, in Kashmir, for we know they were responsible for inviting several scholars and physicians from Kashmir to the Court of Abbasids."" Prof. Maqbool also refers to the descriptions of Kashmir contained in the report prepared by the envoy of Yahya bin Barmak. He surmises that the envoy could have possibly visited Kashmir during the reign of Samgramapida II (797–801). Reference has been made to sages and arts.
The Arabs managed to bring Balkh under their control only in 715 AD, in spite of strong resistance offered by the Balkh people during the Umayyad period. Qutayba ibn Muslim al-Bahili, an Arab General was Governor of Khurasan and the east from 705 to 715. He established a firm hold over lands beyond the Oxus for the Arabs. He fought and killed Tarkhan Nizak in Tokharistan (Bactria) in 715. In the wake of Arab conquest, the resident monks of the Vihara were either killed or forced to abandon their faith. The Viharas were razed to the ground. Priceless treasures in the form of manuscripts in the libraries of monasteries were consigned to ashes. Presently, only the ancient wall of the town, which once encircled it, stands partially. Nava-Vihara stands in ruins, near Takhta-i-Rustam. In 726, the Umayyad governor Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri rebuilt Balkh and installed in it an Arab garrison, while in his second governorship, a decade later, he transferred the provincial capital there.

The Umayyad period lasted until 747, when Abu Muslim captured it for the Abbasids (next Sunni Caliphate dynasty) during the Abbasid Revolution. The city remained in Abbasid hands until 861, when it was taken in 870 by the Saffarids captured it.",4455

== Appearance ==
Józef Razowski and Vitor O. Becker (2016) described the genus as characterized by a slender forewing, usually simple markings and the lack of a terminal row of dots on the forewing. There are usually some strigulae and dots in the subterminal fascia, and the costal half of the median fascia is well developed, often extending near the middle of the median cell posteriorly.


== Distribution ==
Species from this genus are known to occur in Florida, Costa Rica, and Brazil. Specimens have been collected at altitudes ranging from 5 to 1100 meter.


== Species ==
The genus consists of the following thirteen species, listed alphabetically:

Lusterala,genus,wikipedia.org,"Lusterala is a monotypic, neotropical genus of tortix moths provisionally assigned to tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae, with Lusterala phaseolana as sole species.
Genus and species were both described in 2007 by John Wesley Brown and Kenji Nishida. The holotype is conserved at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC. Based on DNA barcoding, the genus is possibly a synonym of Ecdytolopha.


== Behaviour and distribution ==
Lusterala phaseolana is known from Costa Rica. Its larvae are gall-inductive on the stems of their host plant, lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.).

Grapholita,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Grapholita,genus,wikipedia.org,"Grapholita is a large genus of tortrix moths (family Tortricidae). It belongs to subfamily Olethreutinae, and therein to the tribe Grapholitini, of which it is the type genus.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Georg Friedrich Treitschke established Grapholita in 1829 – in the 7th volume of Schmetterlinge von Europa, with a type species he claimed to be ""Pyralis dorsana"", a taxon established by Johan Christian Fabricius in his 1775 Systema Entomologiae. But Treitschke was misled by Jacob Hübner's misidentification of Fabricius' moth.
The actual P. dorsana is today known as Dichrorampha petiverella, as it had already been described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema Naturae as Phalaena (Tinea) petiverella. The ""Pyralis dorsana"" of Hübner and Treitschke was subsequently identified as the species described as Tortrix lunulana by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775, which thus is today Grapholita lunulana.


=== Species ===
Grapholita currently has 126 recognised species, though the genus' distinctness from and delimitation against Cydia is in need of further study:


=== Synonyms ===
Obsolete scientific names (junior synonyms and others) of Grapholita are:

Epinotia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Epinotia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Epinotia is a very large genus of tortrix moths (family Tortricidae). It belongs to the tribe Eucosmini of subfamily Olethreutinae.


== Species ==
166 species of Epinotia were considered valid as of 2009. Though many tortrix moth genera are fairly comprehensively studied, with little other than cryptic species complexes remaining undiscovered, distinct new species of Epinotia are being described every few years or so. With such a large and insufficiently known taxon, it is of course possible that the group may not be monophyletic as circumscribed here:


== Synonyms ==
In particular during the early to mid-19th century, when little of the diversity of Epinotia was known, it was split into many smaller genera. Today however, these are generally – but not universally, e.g. regarding the supposedly monotypic Griselda, or Catastega which is here considered separate but included in Epinotia elsewhere – included here again at least pending a thorough taxonomic review. Now-invalid scientific names (junior synonyms and others) of Epinotia are:

Halonota has also been listed as junior synonym of Epinotia. But its type species Pyralis populana is today placed in Pammene, and thus Halonota is a junior subjective synonym of the latter genus.

Crocidosema,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Crocidosema,genus,wikipedia.org,"Crocidosema is a genus of tortrix moths (family Tortricidae) belonging to the tribe Eucosmini of subfamily Olethreutinae. They are found mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, being especially common in the Neotropics. But some occur elsewhere, such as on the Hawaiian Islands.
At least some of them can be recognized by their wing veins. In the hindwings, vein 3 and 4 originate from a common stalk, and are approached by the fifth vein at its end. In the forewings, veins 4-6 converge at the termen.
These moths are mostly small and inconspicuous. But C. plebejana is an occasional pest of cotton (and some other mostly malvaceous plants) and has become widely distributed by trade in agricultural produce, while the lantana flower-cluster moth (C. lantana) is employed in Lantana biocontrol and has been deliberately introduced to some locations.


== Species ==
As of 2010, the 29 described species of Crocidosema are:

Cydia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Cydia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Cydia  is a graphical user interface of APT for iOS. It enables a user to find and install software unauthorized by Apple on jailbroken iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices. It also refers to the digital distribution platform for software on iOS accessed through Cydia software. Most of the software packages available through Cydia are free of charge, although some require purchasing.
Cydia is developed by Jay Freeman (named ""saurik"") and his company, SaurikIT. The name ""Cydia"" is a reference to the moth genus Cydia, notably the Codling Moth (Cydia pomonella), which eats fruits such as apples and pears.


== Purpose and function ==
Cydia provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to jailbroken users using Advanced Packaging Tool (a package manager) repositories to install software unavailable on the App Store. Cydia is based on APT, ported to iOS as part of Jay Freeman's Telesphoreo project.
Packages are downloaded through a list of repositories. Packages are installed through the list of repositories a user has installed. Apps are installed in the same location as Apple's own applications, in the /Applications directory. Jailbroken devices can also still buy and download apps normally from the official App Store. Some jailbreaking tools install Cydia automatically, while others may not.


=== Software availability ===
Some of the packages available through Cydia are standard applications, while most packages are extensions and modifications for the iOS interface and for apps in the iOS ecosystem. Some Cydia repositories host open source packages as well as paid modifications for jailbroken devices. These modifications are based on a framework called Cydia Substrate (formally MobileSubstrate).
Many ports of existing POSIX-compliant command line tools are available on Cydia as well, including bash, coreutils and OpenSSH, meaning the device could potentially be used as a full-fledged BSD workstation, although missing some development tools.


==== Cydia Store ====
In March 2009, the now-defunct blog TUAW (The Unofficial Apple Weblog) announced that the Cydia Store, the in-app software purchasing system for Cydia, had opened for sales. The announcement also mentioned that Amazon payments was the only option available, but that PayPal would be added in the future. PayPal later became a payment option as well. Cydia stopped accepting Amazon Payments in 2015, leaving PayPal as the sole payment option. After a bug related to PayPal's digital token authorization was discovered via TechCrunch, Freeman decided to shut down the Cydia Store on December 16, 2018.


==== Security ====
The risks in jailbreaking are mixed. Advocates offer that developer tools installed from Cydia can help add extra security. However, being able to install untrusted third-party software can cause data loss and malware. Cydia Substrate, the code injection library usually installed alongside Cydia, will detect if an installed package causes SpringBoard to crash, and will reboot it with all third-party packages temporarily disabled.


== History ==
Freeman first released Cydia in February 2008 as an open-source alternative to Installer.app on iPhone OS 1.1.
In August 2009, Wired reported that Freeman claimed about 4 million, or 10 percent of the 40 million iPhone and iPod Touch owners to date, have installed Cydia.
In September 2010, SaurikIT, LLC, announced that it had acquired Rock Your Phone, Inc. (makers of Rock.app). SaurikIT and Rock Your Phone were the two largest providers of third-party apps at the time.
On December 15, 2010, SaurikIT filed a dispute with World Intellectual Property Organization against Cykon Technology Limited of Kowloon, Hong Kong over the rights to the domain name ""Cydia.com"", which was registered in 2002. SaurikIT contended that Cykon registered the domain name in bad faith and the domain name incorporates SaurikIT's trademark. SaurikIT initially attempted to purchase the domain, then demanded Cykon to forfeit the domain at cost asserting trademark rights followed by bringing a WIPO proceeding. The complaint was denied by WIPO.
As of April 2011, Cydia had a $10 million in annual revenue and 4.5 million weekly users and according to Freeman's $250,000 net annual profit.
On August 18, 2011, SaurikIT filed a lawsuit against Hong Kong owner of Cydia.com regarding the same domain name.
In early 2013, Saurik announced that all of the SHSH data that Cydia had saved for users with devices on iOS 6.0 through iOS 6.1.2 had been corrupted; iOS 6.1.3 SHSH data were unaffected. The TSS Center within Cydia had a notice titled, Where is my ""iOS 6.0–6.1.2""?  (with a sad face emoji at the end). There was no TSS Center before this incident.
On December 24, 2013, Cydia was updated to run on iOS 7 and iOS 7.1.
On October 22, 2014, the Chinese jailbreaking team, Pangu Team, released a jailbreak for iOS 8.0 - 8.1. In response, Saurik quickly updated Cydia to 1.1.13, which added support for iOS 8 and pushed the update to apt.saurik.com for manual download.
On February 26, 2018, CoolStar launched the initial release of Electra, giving access to Cydia from iOS versions 11.0-11.1.2. Alongside Electra for iOS 11, CoolStar released several patches for Cydia, creating a Cydia version compatible with the Electra jailbreak, as Electra had been released while Saurik was still working on updates for Cydia. Saurik eventually released the update, and pushed the update to iOS devices running iOS 11 with Cydia at the time. CoolStar's patched version of Cydia turned out to be incompatible with Saurik's new update.

Anacrusis,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Anacrusis,genus,wikipedia.org,"In poetic and musical meter, and by analogy in publishing, an anacrusis (from Ancient Greek: ἀνάκρουσις, anákrousis, literally: 'pushing up', plural anacruses) is a brief introduction. In music, it is also known as a pickup beat, or fractional pick-up, i.e. a note or sequence of notes, a motif, which precedes the first downbeat in a bar in a musical phrase.
It is a set of syllables or notes, or a single syllable or note, which precedes what is considered the first foot of a poetic line (or the first syllable of the first foot) in poetry and the first beat (or the first beat of the first measure) in music that is not its own phrase, section, or line and is not considered part of the line, phrase, or section which came before, if any.


== Poetry ==
In poetry, a set of extrametrical syllables at the beginning of a verse is said to stand in anacrusis (Ancient Greek: ἀνάκρουσις ""pushing up""). ""An extrametrical prelude to the verse,"" or, ""extrametrical unstressed syllables preceding the initial lift."" The technique is seen in Old English poetry, and in lines of iambic pentameter, the technique applies a variation on the typical pentameter line causing it to appear at first glance as trochaic. Below, the anacrusis in the fourth line of William Blake's poem ""The Tyger"" (with punctuation modernized) is in italics:

The poem is in trochaic tetrameter, in which the first syllable of each line is expected to be stressed, but the fourth line begins with the additional unstressed syllable ""Could"".

Anacrusis is an optional unstressed syllable that appears immediately before the first lift at the beginning of the verse. As an extrametrical element, it does not constitute an independent metrical position; rather, added as a supplement to the following stressed syllable, it counts as part of the lift.


== Music ==
The word anacrusis is introduced by Westphal ... The anacrusis merely consists of the unaccented note or notes which precede the first accent of any rhythmic division in a composition.In music, an anacrusis (also known as a pickup, or fractional pick-up) is a note or sequence of notes, a motif, which precedes the first downbeat in a bar in a musical phrase. ""The span from the beginning of a group to the strongest beat in the group."" Anacrusis, especially reoccurring anacrusis (anacrusis motif played before every measure or every other measure), ""is a common means of weighting the first beat,"" and thus strengthening or articulating the meter.
The term is borrowed from the terminology of poetry. Anacruses may involve fine details such as rhythm and phrasing or may involve wider features such as musical form (such as when used repeatedly).

Very often, a melodic line will start with what is referred to as an anacrusis. An anacrusis is an unstressed pickup or lead-in note or group of notes that precedes the first accented note of a phrase (a short unit of musical line). The accented note of the phrase is found in the first complete measure of music.
The anacrusis is a perceived grouping which is context generated in the individual phrasing of a concrete composition. The grouping of one or more antecedent tone events to a perceived phrase gestalt may be rhythmically evoked by their temporal proximity to the phrase's first downbeat (perceived phrase onset).
Although the anacrusis is integrated in a musical phrase gestalt (grouped to it), it is not located in the perceived 'body' of the phrase (which is spanning from its first downbeat to its ending beat) but before the phrase (hence the German term ""Auftakt""; literally: ""upbeat""). In this respect – in a sequence of phrases – the anacrusis also may be perceived 'between' two phrases, neither being perceived as part of the ending of a former one, nor being located in the following one.

When a melody begins with an anacrusis, the phrasing and inflection must be thought of in terms of the first significant tone of the melody. If we focus on the important tone we are moving toward, the anacrusis will naturally lead there with proper nuance. [emphasis added]
This idea of directionality of beats is significant when you translate its effect on music. The crusis of a measure or a phrase is a beginning; it propels sound and energy forward, so the sound needs to lift and have forward motion to create a sense of direction. The anacrusis leads to the crusis, but doesn't have the same 'explosion' of sound; it serves as a preparation for the crusis.
Outside of that the term of the anacrusis is most commonly used where it applies everywhere else 'within' the 'body' of the phrase between the 'head' (first downbeat) and the 'foot' (ending beat) where, by what ever musical means, a grouping is perceived from an upbeat to a downbeat (especially also to the phrases ending beat).

Anacrusis, or upbeat, seems rather like a continuation released from its dependency on a prior beginning, unanchored, and (in some cases) seeming to come, as it were, 'from nowhere.' Anacrusis points forward: it is anticipatory, directed toward a future event.

Since an anacrusis ""is an incomplete measure that allows the composition [or section or phrase] to start on a beat other than one,"" if an anacrusis is present, the first bar after the anacrusis is assigned bar number 1, and Western standards for musical notation often include the recommendation that when a piece of music begins with an anacrusis, the notation should omit a corresponding number of beats from the final bar of the piece, or the final bar before a repeat sign, in order to keep the length of the entire piece at a whole number of bars. This final partial measure is the complement. However, an anacrusis may last an entire bar.


=== Examples ===
In the song ""Happy Birthday to You"", Happy is the anacrusis and the accent is on the first syllable of Birthday.

In ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", the word O! in the first line is an anacrusis in the music:

At the beginning of the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"", ""In the"" is the anacrusis, while ""town"" falls on the downbeat.

Henricus,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Henricus,genus,wikipedia.org,"The ""Citie of Henricus""—also known as Henricopolis, Henrico Town or Henrico—was a settlement in Virginia founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1611 as an alternative to the swampy and dangerous area around the original English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. Named for Henry, Prince of Wales (1594–1612), the eldest son of King James I, Henricus is located on a former curl of the James River about 12 miles southeast of the modern city of Richmond, Virginia or 15 miles from the fall line of the James River.
Today, the settlement is interpreted via Henricus Historical Park, a living history museum. It is surrounded by the Dutch Gap Conservation Area, an 810 acre mixture of woodlands and wetlands operated by Chesterfield County, Virginia. Captain Dale (who had previously served as a mercenary with Dutch forces) ordered a channel dug which attempted to shorten the river meander, hence the name Dutch Gap. As discussed below, the channel was re-dug during the American Civil War, which created Farrar's Island, which after further dredging became the main course of the James River around 1870. The park and conservation area are on the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail.


== History ==
The second successful English colonial settlement in the New World, Henricus was opposite to the Native American village of  Arrohateck.  At the time, the First Anglo-Powhatan War was raging, and the Indian tribes of Virginia offered continuous resistance to colonial settlement, largely orchestrated by native leader Nemattanew — or as the colonists knew him, ""Jack-of-the-Feather"". Before the development of Richmond, Henricus was one of the westernmost outlying developments from the Colony of Virginia's fortified capital downriver at Jamestown. In 1612–1613, a facility known as ""Mt. Malady"" was built nearby; it was the first hospital in the English colonies of North America.
This settlement was near where Pocahontas grew up among the Appomattoc tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy. Reverend Alexander Whitaker converted her to Christianity during her captivity at Henricus under Sir Thomas Dale, deputy governor of the colony. She met colonist John Rolfe during this time and they married on April 5, 1614. Rolfe's longtime friend, Richard Buck, presided at their wedding. They lived together across the river at the Varina Farms Plantation. Their mixed-race son, Thomas Rolfe (named for Sir Thomas Dale, deputy governor of the colony of Virginia), was born on the plantation. His descendants were among many of the First Families of Virginia (FFV).


=== Proposed college at Henricus ===
The Virginia Company tried to found the first institution of higher education in British America. In 1618, they obtained a royal charter from King James I of England for a proposed University of Henrico. In 1619, the historic First Virginia General Assembly met at Jamestown and passed their 5th Petition: ""Send men to erect the Colledge"", referred to it as ""A worke of Conversion"", and set aside land for it adjacent to and above Henricus. In 1619, Henricus was also incorporated into the City of Henrico. The fort was abandoned by governor's orders during the Indian massacre of 1622, and largely destroyed by the Powhatan afterwards.
By 1623, more settlers occupied the college land than before the massacre. The next year James I dissolved the Virginia Company, seizing its assets and transforming the proprietary colony into a royal one. The Crown controlled it from then on.


=== End of colonial era ===
Henricus became part of the Shire of Henrico (created 1634) and was renamed Henrico County in 1637. Virginia Company stockholder William Farrar acquired the property in 1637 and his descendants sold it to Thomas Randolph in 1737. Meanwhile, in 1693, the College of William and Mary was established in Williamsburg under a new charter granted by the joint English monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II. A plaque on the Wren Building, the college's first structure, ascribes the institution's origin to ""the college proposed at Henrico"".


== Modern era ==

The area later saw action during the American Revolutionary War. During the American Civil War, it played a minor role in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign and in 1865 the Battle of Trent's Reach, one of the last major naval engagement of the conflict, was fought offshore. In the interim, Union General Benjamin Butler ordered troops to excavate the narrow neck of Farrar's Island on which Henricus was located to create the Dutch Gap Canal in an attempt to bypass Confederate defensive batteries along the James River. The channel was widened in 1870, and became the main channel of the James River, and the old river channel silted up, forming what is now the 810-acre (3.3 km2) Dutch Gap Conservation Area.
In 1922, Chesterfield County annexed the former location of Henricus south of the Dutch Gap Canal from Henrico County. 
The area became used for sand and gravel mining, and sunken ships are still visible in the lagoon. Dominion Power still operates Chesterfield Power Station, with controversial coal ash lagoons adjoining the Dutch Gap Conservation area.
Over time, the exact location of the former town of Henricus became uncertain. After archeological excavations, the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972 listed the 12-acre (4.9 ha) archeological site in Chesterfield County as Henrico. Though archaeological evidence of the actual settlement has not been found (due to the creation of Dutch Gap and other disturbances including the nearby quarries), a reconstruction based on historical evidence of the settlement was created nearby as a living history museum, Henricus Historical Park.

Olethreutes,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Olethreutes,genus,wikipedia.org,"Olethreutes is a large genus of tortrix moths (family Tortricidae). It is the type genus of its tribe (Olethreutini) and subfamily (Olethreutinae).
Celyphoides, Loxoterma and Paracelypha are sometimes listed as junior synonyms of Olethreutes. But the type species of the first is Tortrix flavipalpana (now Celypha flavipalpana), that of the second is T. latifasciana (now C. aurofasciana), and that of the third is Phalaena rivulana (now Syricoris rivulana). This makes Celyphoides and Loxoterma junior subjective synonyms of Celypha and Paracelypha a junior subjective synonym of Syricoris, at least according to the present delimitation of these genera.


== Species ==
This genus has long served as ""wastebin genus"" for Olethreutinae, many of which were formerly placed here but are nowadays assigned to related genera. Especially Argyroploce was included in Olethreutes by some authors even in recent times. Phiaris micana (the type species of Phiaris) has erroneously been listed in the present genus, even though Phiaris is generally regarded as distinct; its delimitation versus Olethreutes requires more study however.
The 131 species at least provisionally placed in Olethreutes today are:

Tecmessa, daughter of Teleutas, King of Phrygia, or Teuthras, King of Teuthrania in Mysia, or Tethras or Teuthas. During the Trojan War, Telamonian Ajax kills Tecmessa's father and takes her captive; his reason for doing so may have been, as the 1st-century BC Roman poet, Horace, wrote, that Ajax was captivated by Tecmessa's beauty. In Sophocles' Ajax, Tecmessa unsuccessfully tries to dissuade Ajax from committing suicide. She is the first to find his corpse, which she promptly covers with her own clothing to prevent further heartache. Their infant son, Eurysaces, however, survives the incident.

Due to scanty historical records, little is known of the man or his activities.  He was sent out from Susa to replace Tissaphernes in 395 BC, and, after arresting his predecessor, executed him.
To remove the threat to his satrapy posed by the Spartan army of Agesilaus, Tithraustes persuaded Agesilaus to march north into the satrapy of Pharnabazus, and provided him with money for the march.  After this event, no further actions of his can be traced.
Xenophon states that it was Tithraustes who dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes to Greece to stir up opposition to Sparta, but this seems unlikely for chronological reasons.

Nola,genus,wikipedia.org,"Nola is a town and a municipality in the Metropolitan City of Naples, Campania, southern Italy. It lies on the plain between Mount Vesuvius and the Apennines. It is traditionally credited as the diocese that introduced bells to Christian worship.


== History ==


=== Prehistory ===

Excavations at Nola-Croce del Papa have uncovered extensive evidence of a small village quickly abandoned at the time of the Avellino Eruption in the 17th century BC. This powerful eruption from Mount Vesuvius caused the inhabitants to leave behind a wide range of pottery and other artefacts. The foundations of their buildings are also preserved in imprints among the mud left by the eruption.


=== Antiquity ===

Nola was one of the oldest cities of Campania, with its most ancient coins bearing the name Nuvlana. It was later said to have been founded by the Ausones, who were certainly occupying the city by c. 560 BC. It once vied in luxury with Capua. 
During the Roman invasion of Campania in the Samnite War in 328 BC, Nola was probably occupied by the Oscans in alliance with the Samnites. Nola sent 2000 troops to defend Naples against the Romans (Paleopolis/Neapolis) in 327 BC. The Romans took Nola in 313 BC after setting fire to buildings near the city walls.
Under Roman rule during Hannibal's invasion of Italy amid the Second Punic War, the city was the site of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battles of Nola. On two occasions (215 and 214 BC), it was defended by Marcellus. 
In 90 BC it fell by treason to the Samnites during the Social War. In 89 BC, Sulla routed the rebel army near Pompeii, chased them to Nola and there massacred 20,000 rebels at the Battle of Nola  in front of the walls.
It was stormed in 73-72 BC by Spartacus during his failed slave revolt. 
The 1st c. BC saw a number of public buildings constructed including the amphitheatre. The emperor Augustus died nearby at his sumptuous villa at Somma Vesuviana on 19 August AD 14, in allegedly the same room his father died in 72 years earlier. 
Augustus and Vespasian settled colonies in the area. In the Roman road network, Nola lay between Capua and Lower Nocera on the Via Popilia. A branch road ran from it to Abella and Avellino. Nola was connected to the plentiful water supply of the Serino aqueduct after 20 BC.
Though a relative backwater, Nola retained its status as a municipium, its own institutions, and the use of the Oscan language. It was divided into pagi, the names of some of which are preserved: Pagus Agrifanus, Capriculanus, Lanitanus. The discoveries of the pavement of the ancient city have not been noted with sufficient care to recover most of the plan, but a large number of Grecian vases were made at Nola, using its fine yellow clay and a shining black glaze. They are decorated with red figures.
Following the rise of Christianity, it became a bishopric. One bishop, the Christian senator Paulinus, is traditionally credited with the introduction of the use of bells to Christian worship. His small handbells were subsequently known as nolas for his seat and the larger tower bells as campanas from the surrounding area. Revered as a saint, Paulinus's relics turned the town into a site of Christian pilgrimage.


=== Middle Ages ===
Nola was sacked by Alaric in 410 and by the Vandals under Gaiseric in 453. It was sacked by Muslims in 806 and 904 and captured by Manfred of Sicily in the 13th century. Under Charles of Anjou, it was held by Guy de Montfort as the County of Nola. It was inherited by his eldest daughter's Orsini husband and then held by members of their family.


=== Modern age ===
The 1460 Battle of Nola is noteworthy for the clever stratagem by which John, duke of Calabria, defeated Ferdinand, king of Naples, who fled the field with only 20 followers. Ferdinand, however, was supported by Pope Pius II, the duke of Milan, and the Albanian lord Skanderbeg. With his wife Isabella successfully wooing John's major supporters away, the king recovered his domain over the next decade. Nola itself subsequently lost its importance after its repeated destruction by earthquakes in the 15th and 16th centuries. The nearby Cicala Castle was the birthplace of Giordano Bruno (b. 1548).
In 1820, General Pepe's revolution began in Nola. The sculptor Giovanni Merliano was a native of the city; and some of his works are preserved in the cathedral.
Nola is a suburb of Naples. It is connected to the central city by a suburban railway, the Circumvesuviana. Passengers can ride direct to Napoli Porta Nolana railway station near the Porta Nolana,  Napoli Centrale railway station, and stations at Pomigliano d’Arco and Baiano. Connecting trains in that system go to the tourist attractions of Pompeii and Herculaneum.
In the 1990s to the 2000s, a waste management crisis broke out in the city as a result of illegal dumping by the Camorra. Most of the waste was dumped between Nola, Acerra, and Marigliano, referred to as the ""Triangle of Death"". A 2004 study by Alfredo Mazza published in The Lancet Oncology revealed that deaths by cancer in the area are much higher than the European average.

St Thomas's (Basilica di San Tommaso; built in the 3rd century, decorated with frescoes 9–11th century, later renovated)
Other Roman ruins, including a temple to Augustus, survived as long as the 16th century, they were then plundered for building material and few signs remain. A few tombs are preserved, and results from excavations are displayed at the Archaeological Museum. Other sites include:

Nola Cathedral: a Gothic church (rebuilt in 1593, and again starting 1866)
Old Cathedral (Basilica of SS Apostoli; according to tradition, first built AD 95, rebuilt 1190, reduced 1593, renovated in the Baroque style 1740s)
Orsini Palace (Palazzo Orsini; first built in 1470, later modified and renovated)

=== Roman amphitheatre ===
The passion for gladiatorial combat was at its strongest in Campania among the locals and also the army veterans. So a permanent building for these was erected, as elsewhere, in the 1st c. BC, holding 20,000 spectators. The site was just inside the northern walls where existing buildings were demolished and one side of the arena took advantage of the wall embankment. The podium was faced with sheets of white marble elaborately carved with scenes and finished at the top with a balustrade with the same stone.
It was partially rebuilt and renovated over the centuries, maybe after earthquakes. By the end of the 5th century it was abandoned and used as a quarry. The eruption of Vesuvius in the early 6th century and the subsequent flood partially buried the building and saved some of it for posterity, including marble in the process of being carried away.

== Culture ==
Two fairs are held in Nola: one on 14 June and another on 12 November. The Festival of the Lilies (Festa dei Gigli) is held on 22 June or the Sunday beforehand, honouring St Paulinus. It lasts seven days, until the next Sunday. Eight lilies and a boat are made of wood and covered with papier-mache from the city's art shops. On the last day of the festival, the huge lilies are carried through the town on residents' shoulders along a route that has been followed for more than a thousand years. Each represents one of the local guilds or corporations, coming in the following order:

Greengrocers (Ortolano)
Butchers of pigs (Salumiere)
Innkeepers (Bettoliere)
Bakers (Panettiere)
Boatmakers (Barca)
Butchers of other meats (Beccaio)
Shoemakers (Calzolaio)
Smiths (Fabbro)
Dressmakers (Sarto)
Each of the organizations is responsible for one day of the festivities. The 2010 festival—along with its fellows—was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is possible that the design of the gigli may have influenced the design of the Watts Towers.

Nola,genus,artfakta.se,"Fjärilarna i släktet är små, ofta gråtecknade eller vitaktiga och har som regel tydliga, mörka tvärlinjer. Flera arter är till förväxling lika varandra, och en del varierar även kraftigt i utseendet vilket ofta försvårar en korrekt artbestämning. Fjärilarna har i framvingarnas diskfält tre små pucklar av mer uppåtstående och längre vingfjäll (fjällpucklar) och har tillsammans med arterna i släktet Meganola p.g.a detta ett karakteristiskt utseende inom familjen Nolidae. Släktet skiljer sig från Meganola på flera sätt, de nordiska arterna främst genom att de saknar vingribborna R2 och R3. Dessutom är genitalierna hos hanarna karakteristiska eftersom genitalklaffarna är djupt delade i två långsmala lober. Kokongen är båtformig, ca 12–13 mm lång och har ett tydligt eller t.o.m. spetsliknande framhörn ovanför kläckningsspringan. Hos flera arter vävs barkbitar in i kokongväggen. Flera av de nordeuropeiska arterna är ofta aktiva i den tidiga skymningen, och andra är i första hand aktiva under natten. Släktet omfattar mer än 110 arter som förekommer utbrett i Holarktis och i den indoaustraliska regionen. I Palearktis förekommer åtminstone 31 arter och i Europa tolv.",1176

Diphthera,genus,wikipedia.org,"Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Most infections are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical course, but in some outbreaks, the mortality rate approaches 10%.  Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe, and usually start two to five days after exposure. Symptoms often develop gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, a grey or white patch develops in the throat, which can block the airway, and create a barking cough similar to what is observed in croup. The neck may also swell, in part due to the enlargement of the facial lymph nodes. Diphtheria can also involve the skin, eyes, or genitals, and can cause complications, including myocarditis (which in itself can result in an abnormal heart rate), inflammation of nerves (which can result in paralysis), kidney problems, and bleeding problems due to low levels of platelets.
Diphtheria is usually spread between people by direct contact, through the air, or through contact with contaminated objects. Asymptomatic transmission and chronic infection are also possible. Different strains of C. diphtheriae are the main cause in the variability of lethality, as the lethality and symptoms themselves are caused by the exotoxin produced by the bacteria. Diagnosis can often be made based on the appearance of the throat with confirmation by microbiological culture. Previous infection may not protect against reinfection.
A diphtheria vaccine is effective for prevention, and is available in a number of formulations. Three or four doses, given along with tetanus vaccine and pertussis vaccine, are recommended during childhood. Further doses of the diphtheria–tetanus vaccine are recommended every ten years. Protection can be verified by measuring the antitoxin level in the blood. Diphtheria can be prevented in those exposed, as well as treated with the antibiotics erythromycin or benzylpenicillin. In severe cases a tracheotomy may be needed to open the airway.
In 2015, 4,500 cases were officially reported worldwide, down from nearly 100,000 in 1980. About a million cases a year are believed to have occurred before the 1980s. Diphtheria currently occurs most often in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Indonesia. In 2015, it resulted in 2,100 deaths, down from 8,000 deaths in 1990. In areas where it is still common, children are most affected. It is rare in the developed world due to widespread vaccination, but can re-emerge if vaccination rates decrease. In the United States, 57 cases were reported between 1980 and 2004. Death occurs in 5–10% of those diagnosed. The disease was first described in the 5th century BC by Hippocrates. The bacterium was identified in 1882 by Edwin Klebs.


== Signs and symptoms ==

The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection. They include fever of 38 °C (100.4 °F) or above; chills; fatigue; bluish skin coloration (cyanosis); sore throat; hoarseness; cough; headache; difficulty swallowing; painful swallowing; difficulty breathing; rapid breathing; foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge; and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a ""pseudomembrane."" It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making it very hard to breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.


=== Diphtheritic croup ===
Laryngeal diphtheria can lead to a characteristic swollen neck and throat, or ""bull neck."" The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition, characterized by a brassy or ""barking"" cough, stridor, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing; and historically referred to variously as ""diphtheritic croup,"" ""true croup,"" or sometimes simply as ""croup."" Diphtheritic croup is extremely rare in countries where diphtheria vaccination is customary. As a result, the term ""croup"" nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms.


== Transmission ==
Human-to-human transmission of diphtheria typically occurs through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Breathing in particles released from the infected individual leads to infection. Contact with any lesions on the skin can also lead to transmission of diphtheria, but this is uncommon. Indirect infections can occur, as well. If an infected individual touches a surface or object, the bacteria can be left behind and remain viable. Also, some evidence indicates diphtheria has the potential to be zoonotic, but this has yet to be confirmed. Corynebacterium ulcerans has been found in some animals, which would suggest zoonotic potential.


== Mechanism ==
Diphtheria toxin (DT) is produced only by C. diphtheriae infected with a certain type of bacteriophage.  Toxinogenicity is determined by phage conversion (also called lysogenic conversion); i.e., the ability of the bacterium to make DT changes as a consequence of infection by a particular phage. DT is encoded by the tox gene. Strains of corynephage are either tox+ (e.g., corynephage β) or tox− (e.g., corynephage γ). The tox gene becomes integrated into the bacterial genome. The chromosome of C. diphtheriae has two different but functionally equivalent bacterial attachment sites (attB) for integration of β prophage into the chromosome.
The diphtheria toxin precursor is a protein of molecular weight 60 kDa. Certain proteases, such as trypsin, selectively cleave DT to generate two peptide chains, amino-terminal fragment A (DT-A) and carboxyl-terminal fragment B (DT-B), which are held together by a disulfide bond. DT-B is a recognition subunit that gains entry of DT into the host cell by binding to the EGF-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor  on the cell surface. This signals the cell to internalize the toxin within an endosome via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the endosome, DT is split by a trypsin-like protease into DT-A and DT-B. The acidity of the endosome causes DT-B to create pores in the endosome membrane, thereby catalysing the release of DT-A into the cytoplasm.
Fragment A inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor EF-2—a protein that is essential to the translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.
ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 is reversed by giving high doses of nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3), since this is one of the reaction's end products, and high amounts drive the reaction in the opposite direction.


== Diagnosis ==
The current clinical case definition of diphtheria used by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  is based on both laboratory and clinical criteria.


=== Laboratory criteria ===
Isolation of C. diphtheriae from a Gram stain or throat culture from a clinical specimen.
Histopathologic diagnosis of diphtheria by Albert's stain.


=== Toxin demonstration ===
In vivo tests (guinea pig inoculation): Subcutaneous and intracutaneous tests.
In vitro test: Elek's gel precipitation test, detection of tox gene by PCR, ELISA, ICA.


=== Clinical criteria ===
Upper respiratory tract illness with sore throat.
Low-grade fever (above 39 °C (102 °F) is rare).
An adherent, dense, grey pseudomembrane covering the posterior aspect of the pharynx; in severe cases, it can extend to cover the entire tracheobronchial tree.


=== Case classification ===
Probable: a clinically compatible case that is not laboratory-confirmed, and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case.
Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is either laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case.
Empirical treatment should generally be started in a patient in whom suspicion of diphtheria is high.


== Prevention ==

Vaccination against diphtheria is commonly done in infants, and delivered as a combination vaccine, such as a DPT vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus). Pentavalent vaccines, which vaccinate against diphtheria and four other childhood diseases simultaneously, are frequently used in disease prevention programs in developing countries by organizations such as UNICEF.


== Treatment ==
The disease may remain manageable, but in more severe cases, lymph nodes in the neck may swell, and breathing and swallowing are more difficult. People in this stage should seek immediate medical attention, as obstruction in the throat may require intubation or a tracheotomy. Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. Diphtheria can also cause paralysis in the eye, neck, throat, or respiratory muscles. Patients with severe cases are put in a hospital intensive care unit, and given diphtheria antitoxin (consisting of antibodies isolated from the serum of horses that have been challenged with diphtheria toxin). Since antitoxin does not neutralize toxin that is already bound to tissues, delaying its administration increases risk of death. Therefore, the decision to administer diphtheria antitoxin is based on clinical diagnosis, and should not await laboratory confirmation.
Antibiotics have not been demonstrated to affect healing of local infection in diphtheria patients treated with antitoxin. Antibiotics are used in patients or carriers to eradicate C. diphtheriae, and prevent its transmission to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends either:

Metronidazole
Erythromycin is given (orally or by injection) for 14 days (40 mg/kg per day with a maximum of 2 g/d), or
Procaine penicillin G is given intramuscularly for 14 days (300,000 U/d for patients weighing <10 kg, and 600,000 U/d for those weighing >10 kg); patients with allergies to penicillin G or erythromycin can use rifampin or clindamycin.
In cases that progress beyond a throat infection, diphtheria toxin spreads through the blood, and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications that affect other organs, such as the heart and kidneys. Damage to the heart caused by the toxin affects the heart's ability to pump blood, or the kidneys' ability to clear wastes. It can also cause nerve damage, eventually leading to paralysis. About 40–50% of those left untreated can die.


== Epidemiology ==

Diphtheria is fatal in 5–10% of cases. In children under five years and adults over 40 years, the fatality rate may be as much as 20%. In 2013, it resulted in 3,300 deaths, down from 8,000 deaths in 1990. Better standards of living, mass immunization, improved diagnosis, prompt treatment, and more effective health care have led to a decrease in cases worldwide.


== History ==
In 1613, Spain experienced an epidemic of diphtheria, referred to as El Año de los Garrotillos (The Year of Strangulations).
In 1705, the Mariana Islands experienced an epidemic of diphtheria and typhus simultaneously, reducing the population to about 5,000 people.
In 1735, a diphtheria epidemic swept through New England.
Before 1826, diphtheria was known by different names across the world. In England, it was known as ""Boulogne sore throat,"" as the illness had spread from France. In 1826, Pierre Bretonneau gave the disease the name diphthérite (from Greek διφθέρα, diphthera 'leather'), describing the appearance of pseudomembrane in the throat.
In 1856, Victor Fourgeaud described an epidemic of diphtheria in California.
In 1878, Princess Alice (Queen Victoria's second daughter) and her family became infected with diphtheria; Princess Alice and her four-year-old daughter, Princess Marie, both died.
In 1883, Edwin Klebs identified the bacterium causing diphtheria, and named it Klebs–Loeffler bacterium. The club shape of this bacterium helped Edwin to differentiate it from other bacteria. Over time, it has been called Microsporon diphtheriticum, Bacillus diphtheriae, and Mycobacterium diphtheriae. Current nomenclature is Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

In 1884, German bacteriologist Friedrich Loeffler became the first person to cultivate C. diphtheriae. He used Koch's postulates to prove association between C. diphtheriae and diphtheria. He also showed that the bacillus produces an exotoxin.
In 1885, Joseph P. O'Dwyer introduced the O'Dwyer tube for laryngeal intubation in patients with an obstructed larynx. It soon replaced tracheostomy as the emergency diphtheric intubation method.
In 1888, Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin showed that a substance produced by C. diphtheriae caused symptoms of diphtheria in animals.
In 1890, Shibasaburō Kitasato and Emil von Behring immunized guinea pigs with heat-treated diphtheria toxin. They also immunized goats and horses in the same way, and showed that an ""antitoxin"" made from serum of immunized animals could cure the disease in non-immunized animals. Behring used this antitoxin (now known to consist of antibodies that neutralize the toxin produced by C. diphtheriae) for human trials in 1891, but they were unsuccessful. Successful treatment of human patients with horse-derived antitoxin began in 1894, after production and quantification of antitoxin had been optimized. In 1901, Von Behring won the first Nobel Prize in medicine for his work on diphtheria.
In 1895, H. K. Mulford Company of Philadelphia started production and testing of diphtheria antitoxin in the United States. Park and Biggs described the method for producing serum from horses for use in diphtheria treatment.
In 1897, Paul Ehrlich developed a standardized unit of measure for diphtheria antitoxin. This was the first ever standardization of a biological product, and played an important role in future developmental work on sera and vaccines.
In 1901, 10 of 11 inoculated St. Louis children died from contaminated diphtheria antitoxin. The horse from which the antitoxin was derived died of tetanus. This incident, coupled with a tetanus outbreak in Camden, New Jersey, played an important part in initiating federal regulation of biologic products.
On 7 January 1904, Ruth Cleveland died of diphtheria at the age of 12 years in Princeton, New Jersey. Ruth was the eldest daughter of former President Grover Cleveland and the former First Lady, Frances Folsom.
In 1905, Franklin Royer, from Philadelphia's Municipal Hospital, published a paper urging timely treatment for diphtheria and adequate doses of antitoxin. In 1906, Clemens Pirquet and Béla Schick described serum sickness in children receiving large quantities of horse-derived antitoxin.
Between 1910 and 1911, Béla Schick developed the Schick test to detect pre-existing immunity to diphtheria in an exposed person. Only those who had not been exposed to diphtheria were vaccinated. A massive, five-year campaign was coordinated by Dr. Schick. As a part of the campaign, 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with an appeal to parents to ""Save your child from diphtheria."" A vaccine was developed in the next decade, and deaths began declining significantly in 1924.
In 1919, in Dallas, Texas, 10 children were killed and 60 others made seriously ill by toxic antitoxin which had passed the tests of the New York State Health Department. The manufacturer of the antitoxin, the Mulford Company of Philadelphia, paid damages in every case.
During the 1920s, an annual estimate of 100,000 to 200,000 diphtheria cases and 13,000 to 15,000 deaths occurred in the United States. Children represented a large majority of these cases and fatalities. One of the most infamous outbreaks of diphtheria occurred in 1925, in Nome, Alaska; the ""Great Race of Mercy"" to deliver diphtheria antitoxin is now celebrated by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
In 1926, Alexander Thomas Glenny increased the effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid (a modified version of the toxin used for vaccination) by treating it with aluminum salts. Vaccination with toxoid was not widely used until the early 1930s. In 1939, Dr. Nora Wattie, who was the Principal Medical Officer (Maternity and Child Welfare) of Glasgow between 1934– 1964, introduced immunisation clinics across Glasgow, and promoted mother and child health education, resulting in virtual eradication of the infection in the city.
Widespread vaccination pushed cases in the United States down from 4.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1932 to 2.0 in 1937. In Nazi Germany, where authorities preferred treatment and isolation over vaccination (until about 1939–1941), cases rose over the same period from 6.1 to 9.6 per 100,000 inhabitants.
Between June 1942 and February 1943, 714 cases of diphtheria were recorded at Sham Shui Po Barracks, resulting in 112 deaths because the Imperial Japanese Army did not release supplies of anti-diphtheria serum.
In 1943, diphtheria outbreaks accompanied war and disruption in Europe. The 1 million cases in Europe resulted in 50,000 deaths.
During 1948 in Kyoto, 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization due to improper manufacture of aluminum phosphate toxoid.
In 1974, the World Health Organization included DPT vaccine in their Expanded Programme on Immunization for developing countries.
In 1975, an outbreak of cutaneous diphtheria in Seattle, Washington, was reported.
After the breakup of the former Soviet Union in 1991, vaccination rates in its constituent countries fell so low that an explosion of diphtheria cases occurred. In 1991, 2,000 cases of diphtheria occurred in the USSR. Between 1991 and 1998, as many as 200,000 cases were reported in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and resulted in 5,000 deaths. In 1994, the Russian Federation had 39,703 diphtheria cases. By contrast, in 1990, only 1,211 cases were reported.
In early May 2010, a case of diphtheria was diagnosed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake. The 15-year-old male patient died while workers searched for antitoxin.
In 2013, three children died of diphtheria in Hyderabad, India.
In early June 2015, a case of diphtheria was diagnosed at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The six-year-old child who died of the illness had not been previously vaccinated due to parental opposition to vaccination. It was the first case of diphtheria in the country since 1986, as reported by the Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo, or from 1998, as reported by the WHO.
In March 2016, a three-year-old girl died of diphtheria in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium.
In June 2016, a three-year-old, five-year-old, and seven-year-old girl died of diphtheria in Kedah, Malacca, and Sabah, Malaysia.
In January 2017, more than 300 cases were recorded in Venezuela.
In 2017, outbreaks occurred in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, and amongst children unvaccinated due to the Yemeni Civil War.
In November and December 2017, an outbreak of diphtheria occurred in Indonesia, with more than 600 cases found and 38 fatalities.
In November 2019, two cases of diphtheria occurred in the Lothian area of Scotland. Additionally, in November 2019, an unvaccinated 8-year-old boy died of diphtheria in Athens, Greece.
In July 2022, two cases of diphtheria occurred in northern New South Wales, Australia.
In October 2022, there was an outbreak of diphtheria at the former Manston airfield, a former Ministry of Defence (MoD) site in Kent, England, which had been converted to an asylum seeker processing centre. The capacity of the processing centre was 1,000 people, although about 3,000 were living at the site, with some accommodated in tents. The Home Office, the government department responsible for asylum seekers, refused to confirm the number of cases.
In December 2023 there was an outbreak at a school in Luton, in the United Kingdom. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued a statement saying specialists have been providing public health support following confirmation of the diphtheria case at a primary school in Luton. The agency said it is working closely with local and national partners ""to ensure all necessary public health measures are implemented"" following the discovery of the new case. The statement added: ""We have conducted a risk assessment and close contacts of the case have been identified and where appropriate, vaccination and advice will be given to prevent the spread of the infection.""

Motya,genus,wikipedia.org,"Between the promontory of Lilybaeum (Capo Boéo) and that of Aegithallus (San Teodoro), the coast forms a deep bight, in front of which lies a long group of low rocky islets, called the Stagnone. Within these, and considerably nearer to the mainland, lies Motya island formerly called San Pantaleo, on which lie the remains of the ancient city. The island is nearly 850 m (2,790 ft) long and 750 m (2,460 ft) wide, and about 1 km (0.62 mi) (six stadia) from the mainland of Sicily. It was joined to the mainland in ancient times by a causeway, over which chariots with large wheels could reach the town.
The confined space on which the city was built agrees with the description of Diodorus that the houses were lofty and of solid construction, with narrow streets (στενωποί) between them, which facilitated the desperate defence of the inhabitants. Much of the walls, with those of two gateways, can be seen whose circuit is about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi). 
The island of Motya is owned and operated by the Whitaker Foundation (Palermo), known for Marsala wines. The museum has  artifacts that display Egyptian, Corinthian, Attic, Roman, Punic and Hellenic influences.

Garella,genus,wikipedia.org,"Garella (Greek: Γάρελλα) was a Byzantine town and fortress, best known from its history as an episcopal see. Its site is occupied by the modern village of Altınyazı, in Edirne Province of Turkey.


== History ==
Historical references to the town are mostly connected to the local episcopal see. Thus the town first appears in the Second Council of Nicea in 787, where Bishop Sisinnius took part as a suffragan of the Metropolis of Adrianople. In summer 813, during his invasion of Thrace, the Bulgarian ruler Krum captured the town, and partially destroyed it. A boundary marker from the 8th/10th centuries with the inscription kastr[on] Gariala[s] is displayed in the museum at Pliska.
By the time of the Council of Constantinople of 869/870, the see had been raised to an archbishopric. Archbishop Hypatios participated in that council, and was followed by Archbishop Basil, who attended the Council of Constantinople of 879/880. The town and its see remained relatively unimportant and is rarely mentioned during the next few centuries. This is reflected by the relatively low place it held in the various Notitiae Episcopatuum, although it managed to rise from 21st place among 28 archbishoprics in the 10th century to 15th among 44 archbishoprics in the 13th century. Only the existence of lead seals attests to the existence of archbishops Leo (10th/11th century), Theodore (mid-11th century), and Niketas (3rd quarter of 11th century), while an unnamed archbishop of Garella took part in two synods in Constantinople in 1066 and 1067. 
An imperial chrysobull, issued by Alexios I Komnenos in 1104, attests to the possession of the estate Barzachanion at Garella by the Great Lavra monastery; it was exchanged with imperial property near Thessalonica. Following the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Partitio Romaniae mentions the pertinentia de Garelli as one of the domains to be apportioned among the common Crusaders. The Hospital of Sampson in Constantinople was granted estates at Garella by Pope Innocent III in 1210, a deed re-confirmed in 1244.
After the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantines in 1261, the town and the bishopric are better known. In 1274, the unnamed Archbishop of Garella agreed to the Union of the Churches. In 1310, the Archbishop (again unnamed) participated in a synod in Constantinople against the selling of offices, and an Archbishop Paul is attested in a couple of synodal acts in July 1315. At the start the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328, the town was occupied by the forces of Syrgiannes Palaiologos, who shortly after switched sides to support Andronikos III Palaiologos. A synodal act of September 1324 records the dues owed by the archbishopric to the Patriarchate of Constantinople as 24 hyperpyra.
Sometime around 1329/1331, the see of Garella was awarded jointly with that of Lopadion (in Bithynia, vacant due to the Ottoman conquest of the area). In June 1341, the archbishopric was raised to the status of a full metropolitan see. Metropolitan Ioannikios was appointed to the see in or shortly after May 1347, and remained in office until 1355/1356. He is the last known incumbent; as the area was devastated by Turkish raiders and the subsequent Ottoman conquest, the see was probably abolished soon after.
The village remained populated by Greeks until the Greco-Turkish population exchange in 1923. On the eve of the exchange, the village numbered 569 Greek inhabitants.


== Fortress ==
The castle of Garella was situated on an isolated hill to the east of the modern village. The ruins preserve remains of three towers (east, southeast, and west), as well as parts of the curtain wall. Based on the architectural characteristics, and the presence of large amounts of pottery shards from the middle Byzantine period, the castle is probably to be dated in the 12th century.


== Catholic titular see ==
Garella (Latin: Archidioecesis Garellensis) is listed as one of the titular sees of the Roman Catholic Church. Known incumbents are:

Antonio Bonaventura Jeglič (May 17, 1930 - July 10, 1937)
Eduardo Tonna (December 2, 1937 - April 15, 1939)
Gabriel-Joseph-Elie Breynat (December 11, 1939 - March 10, 1954)

Salobrena,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Salobrena,genus,wikipedia.org,"Salobreña (pronounced [saloˈβɾeɲa])  is a town on the Costa Granadina in Granada, Spain. It claims a history stretching back 6,000 years.
There are two main parts of Salobreña; The first is The Old Town which sits atop a rocky prominence and is a cluster of whitewashed houses and steep narrow streets leading up to a tenth-century Moorish castle, called 'Castillo de Salobreña' and it is one of its main tourist attractions.
The second part of Salobreña is new developments which spread from the bottom of the Old Town right to the beach. The whole town is almost surrounded by sugarcane fields on each side along the coast and further inland.
Another tourist attraction in Salobreña is 'El Peñón' (The Rock), which divides two of Salobreña's five beaches and juts out between Playa La Guardia and Playa de la Charca/Solamar and into the sea.


== History ==


=== Geological background ===
At the close of the last glacial maximum, the Motril-Salobreña plain on which Salobreña now stands was not yet land: rather it was a large bay studded with a number of dolomite crags which were islands, most prominently the formation now known as Monte Hacho (73m) and the headland on which Salobreña now stands (110m). The Guadalfeo river drained into the bay, running down the Tajo de los Vados gorge which separates the Sierra de Escalate to the north-east of Salobreña from the Sierra de Chaparral to the west. The river gradually filled the bay with silt comprising post-orogenic, miocenic, and quaternary material, producing a fertile alluvial plain, on which agriculture could begin by the Bronze Age. At this time, the outcrop on which the old town of Salobreña now stands had become a peninsula. Meanwhile, the rocky outcrop of the Peñon, which now juts from La Guardia beach into the sea, remained an island into the seventeenth century. A map of 1722 is the first evidence that the beach had reached it, making it a peninsula.


=== Ancient ===
Archaeological finds show human habitation around Salobreña at the rocky promontory known as the Peñon beginning in the Neolithic period, when the Peñon was still an island, with strata perhaps beginning as early as the palaeolithic period and continuing into the Bronze Age at the Cueva del Capitán (Captain's Cave) in the nearby hamlet of Lobres. Evidence of Bronze Age settlement from around 1500 BCE has also been found on the Salobreña headland and, slightly further inland again, Monte Hacho. Such settlements would have been characteristic of the settlement of easily defensible rocky headlands in the region at the time.
Salobreña is thought to have experienced contact with the Phoenicians around the eighth century BCE and then Greek and Punic culture around the sixth. At this time, its name is attested as Selambina. A major impact of Roman culture is, however, visible for the second century BCE, attested in widespread archaeological finds.


=== Medieval ===
In 713 CE, the region of Elvira (roughly corresponding to the Province of Granada today) came under the Arab rule of Mūsa bin Nusayr, and by the tenth century, a castle (ḥiṣn) at Salobreña is recorded in Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Musa al-Razi's Crónica del moro Rasis. Al-Razi also noted the introduction of the cultivation of sugar cane at Salobreña. The main crop of medieval Salobreña was sugar-cane, though other attested crops include cumin and bananas. By the eleventh century, Ibn Hayyan could refer to Salobreña as a medina ('town'), a denomination that became usual by the fourteenth century, when Salobreña was the seat of government for surrounding hamlets like Vélez de Benaudalla, Molvizar, and Lobres.
In 1489, Granada came under Castilian rule, and Francisco Ramirez de Madrid became governor of Salobreña's fortress and town. The next year, the inhabitants of the town supported the resistance of Muhammad XII of Granada to Castilian rule, which speeded the increase of Castilian migration into the settlement. In 1568-69, the Moriscos of Salobreña participated in revolts.


=== Modern ===
Sugar-cane remained key to the town's economy through the sixteenth century, returning to prominence in the nineteenth. In between, cotton became the dominant crop. The early-modern history of Salobreña is not well understood. In the nineteenth century, however, Salobreña was strategically important in the Spanish War of Independence, and also adopted new steam-technologies for sugar production pioneered in Cuba. The expansion of the town in the second half of the nineteenth century that was driven by a boom in sugar-cane production led to the demolition of the last remains of its medieval walls. By the 1970s, settlement was expanding from the outcrop on which the old town sits onto the alluvial plain below.
Today, the economy of the coastal plain around Salobreña is based on tourism and sugarcane agriculture, while the mountains are characterised by terraced agriculture with almond and, increasingly, sub-tropical fruit trees (with custard apples and avocado pears being the first to be introduced). The last remaining cane sugar factory in Europe was located along the coast just west of the village of La Caleta de Salobreña. It closed in 2006.


== Climate ==

Salobreña's climate is a Mediterranean, semi-arid climate, with annual rainfall of 500mm per year, and whose microclimate is sub-tropical. In the hotter months, average temperatures are around 26 °C, peaking in August around the mid 30 °C's during the day and mid 20 °C's at night and around 13 °C in the colder months. The annual average temperature is 19 °C.

Xantippe,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Xantippe,genus,wikipedia.org,"Xanthippe (; Ancient Greek: Ξανθίππη [ksantʰíppɛː]; fl. 5th–4th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian, the wife of Socrates and mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus. She was likely much younger than Socrates, perhaps by as much as 40 years. In Xenophon's Symposium, she is described by Antisthenes as ""the most difficult, harshest, painful, ill-tempered"" wife; this characterisation of Xanthippe has influenced all subsequent portrayals of her.


== Life ==
Little is known about the life of Xanthippe. The ancient sources that mention her do so primarily to illustrate something about the character of Socrates, rather than provide any biographical information about Xanthippe.  She was probably born around 440 BCE, making her around 30 years younger than Socrates, who was born c. 470.  Xanthippe's father may have been called Lamprocles, and Socrates and Xanthippe's eldest son been named after him; this may have been the Lamprocles mentioned by Aristophanes in the Clouds, who was a well-known musician in fifth-century Athens.
Xanthippe and Socrates apparently married after 423 BCE, as in Aristophanes' Clouds, first produced in that year, Socrates seems to be unmarried. She bore Lamprocles around 415 or 414 BCE.  She may have been the mother of Socrates' other two children, Sophroniscus and Menexenus.  Athenaeus and Diogenes Laertius both report versions of a story that Socrates married twice, once to Xanthippe and once to Myrto, the daughter or granddaughter of Aristides the Just.  This story has generally not been believed by modern scholars, though some have accepted it – for instance J. W. Fitton, who argues that Myrto was Socrates' wife whereas Xanthippe was a citizen pallake (""concubine"").
On the basis of her name (a compound of hippos, ""horse"", which often indicated a noble background) and the fact that her eldest son was, contrary to the usual Athenian practice, not named after Socrates' father, some scholars have suggested that she was from an aristocratic family. Fitton however notes that non-aristocratic Athenians with ""hippos"" names are known, and argues that though Xanthippe was an Athenian citizen she was not from an especially aristocratic family.


== Character ==

Xanthippe is mentioned only once by Plato, in the Phaedo, depicted sitting by Socrates on the night before his execution.  There is no evidence in Plato's portrayal of the shrewish Xanthippe of later tradition.  The characterisation of Xanthippe as a difficult wife derives from Xenophon's depiction of her: in the Memorabilia, though she is not named her son Lamprocles complains of her harshness, and in Xenophon's Symposium, Antisthenes describes her as ""the most difficult, harshest, painful, ill-tempered"" wife.  Socrates says that he chose her precisely because of her argumentative spirit:

It is the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: ""None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me,"" he says; ""the horse for me to own must show some spirit"" in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides. And that is just my case. I wish to deal with human beings, to associate with man in general; hence my choice of wife. I know full well, that if I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human being else.
Later ancient authors, such as Diogenes Laertius, largely follow Xenophon's characterisation of her as a difficult wife.  Several of the anecdotes reported by Diogenes serve to show Socrates' wit, and to contrast his temperament with that of his wife. In one story told by several ancient sources, Xanthippe pours a jug of water over Socrates' head; according to Diogenes he responded with the quip ""Did I not say that thundering Xanthippe also makes water?""


== Legacy ==
Medieval authors who mention Xanthippe largely repeat the ancient anecdotes about her, and follow the example of Xenophon and Diogenes Laertius in portraying her as a difficult wife.  In the Wife of Bath's Tale, for example, Geoffrey Chaucer retells Diogenes' story of Xanthippe pouring a water-jug over Socrates' head, though in his version the jug is filled with urine.  This story has also historically been popular with visual artists.  The first positive portrayal of Xanthippe comes from the 1405 Book of the City of Ladies by Christine de Pizan: her version of Xanthippe attempts to save Socrates from death by taking the poison from him.
This portrayal of Xanthippe continued into the early-modern period. William Shakespeare, for instance, cites her as a proverbially bad wife in The Taming of the Shrew. During the Enlightenment, some followed in the tradition of a shrewish Xanthippe – such as Pieter Langendijk in his Xantippe, of het booze wyf des filozoofs Sokrates beteugeld. Others, however, began to treat her more sympathetically: the German scholar Christoph August Heumann was the first to question the historicity of the negative ancient anecdotes about her.
From the 19th century, feminist authors have also portrayed Xanthippe sympathetically: for instance in the Victorian poet Amy Levy's poem Xanthippe: A Fragment. Some feminist portrayals of Xanthippe present her traditional assertiveness as a positive characteristic: in Cynthia Ozick's ""Puttermesser and Xanthippe"" the golem Xanthippe chooses that name in recognition of her own independence from her creator, as ""Xanthippe alone had the courage to gainsay Socrates"". In modern feminist thought, Xanthippe has been taken as emblematic of the history of women's subjugation.
In his essay ""The Case for Xanthippe"" (1960), Robert Graves suggested that the stereotype of Xanthippe as a misguided shrew is emblematic of an ancient struggle between masculinity (rationality, philosophy) and femininity (intuition, poetry), and that the rise of philosophy in Socrates' time has led to rationality and scientific pursuit coming to exercise an unreasonable dominance over human life and culture.


== In popular culture ==
Xanthippe has a fairly important role in Maxwell Anderson's 1951 play Barefoot in Athens.  In the 1966 Hallmark Hall of Fame television production, she was played by Geraldine Page opposite Peter Ustinov as Socrates.
A fictional account of Xanthippe's relationship with her husband is presented in the play Xanthippe by the British author and playwright Deborah Freeman. Xanthippe was first produced at the Brockley Jack Theatre, London, in 1999.
Xanthippe plays a minor role in the 2018 videogame Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, in which Socrates states that her argumentative nature is what attracted him to her, rather than her looks.


== Honours ==
Asteroid 156 Xanthippe is named in her honour.
In 1995, P. Naskrecki and R.K. Colwell gave the patronym Xanthippe to a genus of flower mite that inhabits flowers of palms of the genus Socratea and is probably phoretic on the beetles that pollinate the palm.
A species of African white-toothed shrew was described by Wilfred Hudson Osgood in 1910 as Crocidura xantippe, common name ""Xanthippe's shrew.""

Tamyra,genus,wikipedia.org,"Tamyra Monica Gray (born July 26, 1979) is an American actress, singer and songwriter, who finished fourth place on the first season of the musical reality competition American Idol in 2002. Post American Idol, Gray has begun acting on Broadway and television. She had a recurring role on the third season of the drama series Boston Public in early 2003.


== Personal life ==
Gray was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, and later moved to Norcross, Georgia. She graduated from Stone Mountain High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia in 1997. She began singing at an early age. She competed in several beauty pageants and was named Miss Atlanta in 1998. Gray attended Georgia State University, majoring in business law and entertainment management. Prior to American Idol, she worked a variety of jobs including daycare worker, party motivator, telemarketer, waitress, and running her own cleaning service. She also filmed Coca-Cola commercials and worked with artists like her friend Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes and rapper DMX with hopes of finding an opening into the entertainment industry.
Gray married Color Me Badd singer Sam Watters (whom she worked with on The Dreamer) on September 2, 2006, in Capri, Italy. About 45 guests were in attendance, including her then-manager, Lisa Braude. Gray's photographer sold the wedding photos to American press, and the low-key relationship soon became public after People broke the story. She is now stepmom to Kieran, Sam's son from a previous marriage. On March 23, 2010, Gray announced to Entertainment Weekly that she was expecting her first baby with Watters.  On July 17, 2010, Gray gave birth to daughter Sienna Marie.


== American Idol ==
In 2002, Gray became one of the ten finalists on the first season of American Idol, eventually finishing fourth. Her performance of the Burt Bacharach classic ""A House Is Not a Home"" was described by Judge Simon Cowell as ""one of the best performances on television"" that he had ever seen.
Gray was also featured on two tracks on the American Idol Christmas CD—a solo version of ""Silent Night"" and a duet version of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" with Ruben Studdard. She also appeared on the Idol Christmas Special on Fox with Clarkson, Studdard, and other finalists from the first two Idol seasons.
During the third season of American Idol, she returned to the show on several occasions to sing ""Raindrops Will Fall"" and ""Star"", songs she co-wrote for her debut album, and to sing the National Anthem to open the final results show of the season. Gray also co-wrote the American Idol season three single ""I Believe"", which was performed by Idol finalists Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. Barrino then released ""I Believe"" as her American Idol single, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Charts.

During the season, many critics and fans thought that Tamyra would make it to the finals, and perhaps win. However, on August 21, Tamyra was placed in the Bottom 2 (along with Nikki McKibbin), and then eliminated from the show.  The judges expressed their shock at the audience decision, while making supportive comments to Gray.


== Music career ==
In 1998, Gray provided background vocals on DMX's song ""Slippin'."" After American Idol, creator Simon Fuller signed Tamyra to his newly formed independent record label, 19 Records, a division of his 19 Management, Gray's first solo album, The Dreamer, which Gray wrote herself, was eventually released on May 25, 2004. The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week in release and has sold 122,000 to date. The H. Hector and J. Vasquez mixes of Tamyra's lead single, ""Raindrops Will Fall,"" peaked at number five on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart; another set of remixes of the same song also hit number nine on that chart. Gray later parted ways with 19 Entertainment but remains close with Fuller, who attended her wedding to Sam Watters in Capri, Italy.
Gray performed a duet with American Idol season one winner Kelly Clarkson on Clarkson's debut release Thankful.  The song, entitled ""You Thought Wrong,"" was co-written by Gray but never released as a single.
Gray was a co-writer and back-up singer on Jessica Simpson's album A Public Affair, which was released August 29, 2006. She is listed fourth in writing credits on the songs ""If You Were Mine"" and ""The Lover in Me"", and sang back-up on ""If You Were Mine"" . The CD debuted on Billboard's 200 Chart at number five.
Gray also co-wrote the number one Billboard Hot 100 song ""I Believe.""
Gray was reported to be in the process of recording a new album. Gray called it more club-friendly, hip-hop-based project than her debut. She is also in the process of finding a record label. Tamyra tweeted that she was in the studio recording a new album with Ryan Tedder and the production team The Runaways which her husband Sam Watters is part of. They had planned to release her album through a major label in 2010.


== Acting career ==
She landed the recurring role of Aisha Clemens, a student in an abusive relationship, on Boston Public, appearing in seven episodes in 2003. She showcased her singing abilities, famously covering Luther Vandross' ""Dance With My Father"" and Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"". She has had guest roles on episodes of Half & Half, Las Vegas, Tru Calling, What I Like About You (TV series), Ghost Whisperer and All Of Us. With other American Idol alumni, she appeared on The Tyra Banks Show in 2006.
She has starred on Broadway twice. In November 2004, Gray was cast for a limited engagement of twelve weeks in the role of Priya in Broadway's struggling Bombay Dreams. Due to continued poor grosses, the show closed early on January 1, 2005. She joined the cast of Rent as Mimi Marquez on May 29, 2007, and was scheduled to play the role until November 25, 2007, however, that six-month contract was extended. Gray performed in Rent until June 15, 2008, and was replaced by Renée Elise Goldsberry.
In October 2005, Gray made her big screen supporting role debut in the independent film The Gospel, which debuted at No. 5 at the box office, and also had strong DVD sales when it was released to stores on January 3, 2006. Gray has one song, ""Now Behold the Lamb"", featured on the movie's soundtrack, which climbed to No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtrack Chart. Her second movie role was in the 2008 movie Rachel Getting Married.
Also in 2005, Gray appeared in a short film for H&M's new line of denim jeans, and performed the Dreamgirls show stopper ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"". Tamyra was featured in print advertisements for the H&M denim and her version of the song played in H&M stores.
In 2011, Gray starred in the musical ""Twist,"" a theatrical version of Oliver Twist set in New Orleans during the Depression, that was produced by Debbie Allen at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California. The musical was scheduled to run from June 14 to July 17, but was extended through July 24 due to strong ticket sales and a string of sold-out shows. In January 2016, she took over the role of Kate on the national tour of If/Then. On January 8, 2018, she took over the role of Papa Ge in the 2018 revival of Once on This Island.

== Etymology ==
The spelling of the genus name differs in some literature. A study by Gielis, 2006 re-evaluated later some specimens and placed several species into Megalorhipida, and consistently uses that same spelling of the genus. That contains is a direct statement as a subheader that ""Megalorrhipida Amsel, 1935a: 293.— Incorrect (of a multiple original) spelling"" to indicate that this alternative spelling is deemed incorrect (on p.201 of Gielis, 2006). That same work notably also includes examination of a taxon named as Megalorhipida pseudodefectalis Gielis, 1989 (on p.203-204 of Gielis, 2006) where a sub-header reads ""Megalorrhipida pseudodefectalis Gielis, 1989a: 107"", presumably to indicated that alternative spelling as unfavored, citing an older study using that spelling. Yet, the author's preferred spelling of the genus is perhaps clarified in another publication of the same year which by inference from the title along seems instead to favor Megalorhipida. The difference in spelling can be due to differing historical usage within the original publication of Amsel, 1935, who appears to have inconsistently using different spellings. Per ICZN, ""32.2.1. If a name is spelled in more than one way in the work in which it was established, then, except as provided otherwise in this Article, the correct original spelling is that chosen by the First Reviser Art. 24.2.3."". This may be in the latter paper by Gielis, 1989, as reflected later, e.g. in Gielis, 2006

Zamagiria,genus,wikipedia.org,"Zamagiria is a genus of small moths belonging to the snout moth family (Pyralidae).  They are part of the huge snout moth subfamily Phycitinae, but their exact relationships are obscure, and they are currently not assigned to a particular  tribe of Phycitinae.
This genus is almost exclusively found in the Neotropics. One species (Z. laidion) ranges north up to Florida, and one other (Z. exedra) was described from a specimen collected on Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands. But the latter may simply have been accidentally introduced, being in reality a Neotropical species whose native range has not yet been discovered.
Zamagiria moths can usually be recognized in the field by their wing veins; the forewing has 11 veins (vein 7 is missing), and veins 4 and 5 almost connect at the base in the forewings, while on the hindwings veins 4 and 5 are connected along half of their entire length.
Species of Zamagiria include:

Zamagiria australella (Hulst, 1900)

Ufa,genus,wikipedia.org,"Ufa ( OO-fə; Russian: Уфа IPA: [ʊˈfa] ; Bashkir: Өфө, romanized: Öfö, IPA: [ʏ̞ˈfʏ̞] ) is the capital and largest city of Bashkortostan, Russia. The city lies at the confluence of the Belaya and Ufa rivers, in the centre-north of Bashkortostan, on hills forming the Ufa Plateau to the west of the southern Ural Mountains, with a population of over 1.1 million residents, up to 1.4 million residents in the urban agglomeration. Ufa is the tenth-most populous city in Russia, and the fourth-most populous city in the Volga Federal District.
The city was founded in 1574, when a fortress was built on the site by the order of Ivan the Terrible. Ufa was made capital of Ufa Governorate in 1865 when the governorate split from Orenburg Governorate. Ufa's population expanded during the early 20th century.
Today, Ufa's economy consists primarily of the oil refining, chemistry, and mechanical engineering industries; the petroleum company Bashneft and several of its subsidiaries are headquartered in Ufa. Ufa is an ethnically diverse city, home to a substantial number of ethnic Bashkirs and Tatars, with an ethnic Russian majority population. Several educational institutions are located in Ufa, including Bashkir State University, Ufa State Aviation Technical University, Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, and Ural State Law University. The city hosted separate summits of the BRICS group as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2015.


== Etymology ==
The name Ufa comes from the Ufa River on which the city lies, but the origin of the river's name is disputed. The Russian linguist Aleksandr Matveyev proposes that the name is of Iranian origin, from ""ap"", meaning water.
In a paper published in 2014, researchers Karimov and Khabibov from Bashkir State Pedagogical University present and argue for a hypothesis according to which before the construction of the foundational Russian fortress in 1574, which has since grown to become the current city of Ufa, there had  already been an ancient settlement called Ufa on a hilltop near the mouth of the Ufa River. According to them, this settlement was founded by Turkic-speaking tribes to perform rituals and sacrifices to the sky god Tengri, and they called this place Upe or Ufe because, they argue, in ancient Turkic languages a place of ritual sacrifice used to be called an ""opo"" or an ""ope."" They further hypothesize that the inhabitants of the settlement themselves also came to be called the Upe or Ufe tribe and subsequently, the river along which they flourished and expanded their settlement towards its source also came to be called Ufa. Karimov and Khabibov claim that the Russian fortress builders were probably aware of this ancient name and consequently named their new settlement Ufa. 
It is colloquially called the City of Three Screws, due to the unusual nature of city's name in Bashkir.


== History ==

Early history of the surrounding area of Ufa dates back to Paleolithic times. Presumably, from the 5th to 16th centuries there was a medieval city on the site of Ufa. On the Pizzigano brothers' map (1367) and on the Catalan Atlas (1375) a town approximately on the Belaya River was designated Pascherti (Bashkort), and Gerardus Mercator's map (1554) also marked the settlement with the name Pascherti. French orientalist Henri Cordier associates the position of Pascherti with the current location of Ufa.
Ibn Khaldun called the town, among the largest cities of the Golden Horde, Bashkort.
Russian historian of the 18th century Peter Rychkov wrote that there was a great city on the territory of Ufa before the arrival of the Russians.
The official of the Orenburg Governorate government Vasily Rebelensky wrote that Ufa was founded by the Bashkirs.

By order of Ivan the Terrible a fortress was built on the site of modern Ufa in 1574, and originally bore the name of the hill it stood on, Tura-Tau. 1574 is now considered to be the official date of Ufa's foundation. Town status was granted to it in 1586.
Before becoming the seat of a separate Ufa Governorate in 1781, the city, along with the rest of the Bashkir lands, was under the jurisdiction of the Orenburg governors. And even though the 1796 reform reunited Orenburg and Ufa again, in 1802, the city of Ufa became a new center of the entire Orenburg Governorate that included large territories of modern-day Republic of Bashkortostan, Orenburg Oblast, and Chelyabinsk Oblast.
The Belaya River Waterway (1870) and the Samara-Zlatoust Railroad (1890) connected the city to the European part of the Russian Empire and stimulated the development of the city's light industry. During World War II, following eastward Soviet retreat in 1941, the Abwehr operated in Ufa, 1941–1943, some German infiltration, occurred 1914–1943 in espionage, many industrial enterprises of the western parts of the Soviet Union were evacuated to Ufa. On June 4th 1989 the Ufa train disaster would occur about 75 kilometers away from the city when a pipeline leak made a cloud of gas near the tracks and when 2 trains approached the sparks from the breaks of one train ignited the gas causing a massive explosion which killed 575 people.
During 9–10 July 2015, Ufa hosted summits of the BRICS group and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

== Ecological problems ==
Periodically, a suffocating, unpleasant chemical odor can be smelled in the Ufa region. The media reports about the smell come out with an impressive regularity. Not all these reports are groundless, and the culprits are getting out of responsibility due to the fact that there is no Continuous Emission Control System (CEMS) in the city.
There are no street vacuum cleaners, road vacuum sweepers, or industrial (street) vacuum cleaners on the streets. Unfortunately, there is a complete lack of sanitation services in the city.
According to the letter of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Roshydromet) No. 20-18 / 218 of 11.07.18: ""In the framework of solving problems at the federal level in the implementation of the state monitoring of atmospheric air, the territorial office of Roshydromet – FGBU Bashkir UGMS monitors pollution of atmospheric air in Ufa at nine stationary posts of the state observation network located in different parts of the city to estimate the level of air pollution generated by the total release and stationary and mobile sources of pollutants. Suspended substances (dust) are measured at all nine posts of the state observation network. The results of observations of the pollutants content are presented on the official website of the Bashkir State Hydrometeorological Service in the section ""Monitoring of environmental pollution"" daily and monthly. In 2017, the maximum single concentration of suspended solids reached 4.6 MPC m. in March 2017, at the address: Oktyabrya Ave., 141, located near the motorway with heavy traffic, and in April 2017 at the post: Dostoyevsky St., 102/1, located in the area of the industrial enterprise. During 2017 almost all posts of the state observation network recorded exceedances of a single concentration of suspended substances. At the same time, in order to implement regional state environmental oversight aimed at preventing, detecting, and suppressing violations by public authorities, local authorities, and legal entities, individual entrepreneurs and citizens of requirements in the field of atmospheric air protection, under the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment of the Republic Bashkortostan operates the State Bank of the Republic of Belarus ""Office of State Analytical Control,"" to whose tasks, including GSI ""organization of periodic environmental monitoring mobile laboratories in the areas where the population lives in the republic and in the zones of protective measures in the system of the general program of integrated environmental and sanitary-hygienic monitoring."" Going to the site found that all 9 posts of the state observational network of Roshydromet are located at a considerable distance from the area of Inors and Sipaylovo, from residential areas. Control of MPC and air quality in residential areas is not carried out.

Davara,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Davara,genus,wikipedia.org,"Davara was a British steam fishing trawler. Launched in 1912, it was requisitioned in 1914 by the Royal Navy for service in World War I and fitted out as a minesweeper. She was returned to her owners after the war and began service as a trawler once more.
On 13 September 1939, twelve days after the outbreak of World War II, U-27 intercepted the Davara on a normal fishing trip. The submarine began to shell the trawler with its deck gun. The hands managed to escape the trawler in a lifeboat, and the Davara sank at 14:55 from the damage inflicted by U-27's deck gun. Her crew remained in the water ""baling and rowing"" for five hours before they were picked up by the steamer Willowpool and safely made landfall. Davara was the first British trawler to be sunk by enemy action in World War II.


== Construction and design ==
Davara (Official Number 132409) was constructed in Selby by the shipbuilder Cochrane & Sons Ltd. On 6 January 1912, the trawler was launched from yard number 517. Christened the Davara by her owners, Mount Steam Fishing Co. Ltd, she was registered in the port of Fleetwood on 6 March 1912 and completed sometime later that same month. She had a net register tonnage of 116 and a gross register tonnage of 291. The trawler was 130 feet (40 m) from bow to stern, with a draught of 12.5 feet (3.8 m) and a breadth of 23.5 feet (7.2 m). Her engine consisted of a T.3-cylinder from C. D. Holmes & Co. Ltd.


== History ==


=== Early service ===
Following completion and registration, Davara began a fishing career off the coast of Ireland and Great Britain. Her service as a trawler continued for about two years uninterrupted. In November 1914, three months after the outbreak of World War I, the trawler was confiscated for war service by the Royal Navy and furnished for minesweeping. Davara survived the war and was returned to Mount Steam Fishing Co. Ltd in 1919, beginning fishing duties anew. On 7 August 1930, the trawler was grounded on ""Tiger's Tail"" during the approach to Wyre Dock in Fleetwood. She was soon re-floated and safely proceeded into the dock.


=== Sinking ===
On 12 September 1939, Davara left Fleetwood for a routine fishing trip off the west coast of Ireland under the command of her skipper, William Boyles. The next day, U-27 spotted the trawler about 21 nautical miles (39 km; 24 mi) northwest by north of Tory Island. U-27 then began shelling Davara with its 8.8 cm SK C/35 deck gun, firing a total of 35 rounds at the trawler. Boyles managed to get a lifeboat into the water and all of the crew abandoned ship.
The shelling of the abandoned Davara continued a further thirty minutes, stopping at 14:55 with the trawler's sinking. The crew remained in the lifeboat for a further five hours. They were eventually picked up by the West Hartlepool steamer Willowpool and landed safely. Davara was the first British trawler, and the seventeenth ship, to be sunk by an enemy submarine in World War II.

Female A. transitella release very similar sex pheromones to that of female Pyralis farinalis. Both species release the pheromone (Z,Z)-11,13-hexa decadienal which is used to attract males. Male P. farinalis have been observed attempting to mate with female A. transitella, but it does not seem as though these copulations are successful in producing offspring.

Tallula,genus,wikipedia.org,"Tallula is a village in Menard County, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1857 by William G. Greene. The population was 434 at the 2020 census, down from 488 in 2010. It is part of the Springfield, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==
William G. Greene, J. G. Greene, Richard Yates, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears laid out Tallula in late 1857. The name of ""Tallula"" was said to be an Indian word. The History of Menard & Mason Counties, Illinois credits Spears with the name, and notes that it was said to mean ""dropping water"", but nothing in the area is especially related to dropping water; the county tourist bureau claims that William G. Greene named the town, that it means ""trickling water"", and that it is related to ""abundant springs in the area"".
Tallula was incorporated as a village under Illinois' general municipal law in 1871 or 1872.  William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877.


== Geography ==
Tallula is located in southwestern Menard County at 39°56′39″N 89°56′15″W (39.944197, -89.937610).  It is at the center of Tallula Precinct. Illinois Route 123 passes through the southeast side of the village, leading northeast 10 miles (16 km) to Petersburg, the county seat, and south 4.5 miles (7.2 km) to Illinois Route 125 between Pleasant Plains and Ashland.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Tallula has a total area of 0.53 square miles (1.37 km2), all land. The village is drained to the north by a tributary of Clary Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the Sangamon River and part of the Illinois River watershed.


== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2000, there were 638 people, 238 households, and 175 families residing in the village. The population density was 1,207.4 inhabitants per square mile (466.2/km2). There were 253 housing units at an average density of 478.8 per square mile (184.9/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 99.06% White, 0.16% Native American, and 0.78% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.63% of the population.
There were 238 households, out of which 37.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.1% were married couples living together, 9.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.1% were non-families. 21.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.07.
In the village, the population was spread out, with 28.8% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 21.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.4 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $38,269, and the median income for a family was $38,864. Males had a median income of $31,250 versus $19,750 for females.

Plutella,genus,artfakta.se,"Släktet Plutella omfattar drygt 40 arter, varav fem finns i Norden. Kålmal P. xylostella har en kosmo­politisk utbredning, och den kan påträffas på de mest isolerade öar ute i oceanerna.
Arterna inom släktet är oftast lätta att känna igen på de framåtriktade antennerna och framvingens vågmönster, som delar vingen i ett ljust och ett mörkt parti. Liksom styltmalarna (familjen Gracillariidae) håller senapsmalarna kroppens främre del mer eller mindre tydligt lyft från underlaget när de vilar. De fullbildade fjärilarna utmärks av utvecklade punktögon (oceller). Släktet Plutella särskiljs från det närstående släktet Rhigognostis på att fjälltofsen på labialpalpernas mellansegment är lika lång som sista segmentet.
Typiskt för hangenitalierna är förekomsten av ett par plattor med borst (homologa med gnathos) på ömse sidor om analröret samt att aedeagus är kortare än genitalklaffarna och liknar ett ankare eller en rocka med mycket lång svans.
Larverna lever på korsblommiga växter (familjen Brassicaceae), i Norden företrädesvis på senap Sinapis spp. Ett viktigt kännetecken för släktet är att kokongen är mycket glest vävd (nätliknande) och har en öppning både i fram- och bakkanten. Puppan kränger sig ut genom den bakre öppningen, vilket är unikt för senapsmalar.
Baraniak (2007) har föreslagit att två nya ­släkten, Pseudoplutella och Plutelloptera, borde skiljas ut på basis av skillnader i framvingens färg och vissa mindre skillnader i genitaliernas byggnad. Eftersom inga avgörande skillnader i dessa karaktärer föreligger mellan de föreslagna släktena och Plutella, behålls emeller­tid Plutella enligt tidigare tolkning.",1635

Inga,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Inga,genus,wikipedia.org,"Inga is a genus of small tropical, tough-leaved, nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, subfamily Mimosoideae. Inga's leaves are pinnate, and flowers are generally white. Many of the hundreds of species are used ornamentally.
Several related plants have been placed into this genus at one time, for example Yopo (Cohoba, Mopo, Nopo or Parica – Anadenanthera peregrina – as Inga niopo).
The seeds are covered with sweet white powder. The pulp covering the seeds is lightly fibrous and sweet, and rich in minerals; it is edible in the raw state. The tree's name originates from the Tupi word in-gá meaning ""soaked"", due to the fruit powder consistency. The tree usually blooms twice a year.
Within the Inga genus there are around 300 species, most of them native and growing in the Amazon forest region although some species are also found in Mexico, Greater and Lesser Antilles and other countries in South America, being an exclusively neotropical genus. The trees are usually found by river and lake edges because their seeds are carried there by floods.

All Inga species produce their seeds in ""bean-like"" pods and some can reach up to 1 m long, in general the pods are 10–30 cm long.
Trees can reach up to 15 metres and they are widely used for producing shade over coffee plants. The plant benefits from well drained soil. The flowers are white with some green and the tree can produce fruits almost all year long.
Inga species, most notably Inga edulis (commonly known as ""ice-cream-bean"" or, in Spanish, guama, guaba, guaba de bejuco or paterna depending on the country or region) often have edible pulp. The name derives from the fact that those of I. edulis resembles vanilla ice cream in flavour.
In Ecuador, Inga edulis is known as guaba de bejuco and, the other popular species there, Inga spectabilis
, as guaba de machete.


== Use in agroforestry ==

Alley cropping techniques using species of Inga have been developed to restore soil fertility, and thereby stem the tide of continual slashing and burning of the rainforest. Species which have proven effective for alley cropping include Inga edulis and Inga oerstediana. Much of the research was done by Mike Hands at Cambridge University over a 20-year period. Inga species are also commonly used as shade trees for coffee, cocoa, and tea.


== Other uses ==
It is often used as lumber in construction and furniture making.

Endrosis,genus,wikipedia.org,"As type species of Endrosis, the white-shouldered house moth was originally included in the genus when it was established (by Jacob Hübner in 1825) as Alucita betulinella, a scientific name established by Johan Christian Fabricius under this name in 1787. But Hübner had misidentified Fabricius' species, which was in reality a tineid moth known today as Nemaxera betulinella. In addition to this case of mistaken identity, the white-shouldered house moth as discussed by Hübner had actually been named Tinea lactella by J. N. C. M. Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. Earlier still, Carl Linnaeus had described the white-shouldered house moth as Phalaena (Tinea) sarcitrella in 1758, but neither Denis and Schiffermüller nor Hübner did remember it. Later authors, who were aware of the earlier descriptions, supposed the taxon of Denis and Schiffermüller or that of Linnaeus to be this type of Endrosis.
Hübner, however, believed to have identified his white-shouldered house moths correctly with Fabricius' A. betulinella and disregarded T. lactella entirely. Thus, the taxon T. lactella (though not the white-shouldered house moth species as a whole) was not included in Endrosis at the genus' inception, and such a change of type species can only be made by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature – it is not permitted in the rules of zoological nomenclature to prevent the confusion and misinterpretations of scientific names that was frequent before the early 20th century.
Over the years, a number of supposed close relatives of the white-shouldered house moth were described. Soon enough, they were all grouped in Endrosis. What remained unclear was how many species there were, and whether any forms stood out. With reports of the species accumulating from all over the world, it was eventually realized that this moth must have tagged along Homo sapiens and spread with human habitation since prehistoric times. In this single global gene pool, few if any current authors recognize more than a single species, E. sarcitrella.",2056

Bassania,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Bassania,genus,wikipedia.org,"Bassania was an Illyrian city that came under Roman control during the Illyrian Wars. It was located close to the ancient city of Lissus in southern Illyria, modern Albania. The inhabitants of the city were called Bassanitae. The time when the Bassanitae became socii of the Romans is still unknown.


== Location ==
Carl Patsch identified Bassania with the village of Pedhanë or Pllanë on the river Mat entering the plain. A recent discovery in modern Bushat village within the Shkodër County suggests an alternative possible location of Bassania in this site. The ruins of the ancient city in Bushat extended in a surface three times of the ancient ruins of Shkodër (nearest city), massive stone walls surrounded an area of about 20 hectares, were discovered by a team of Polish-Albanian Archaeologists in 2018. The city wall is massive. Measuring 3 meters thick, the wall is made from huge stone blocks packed tightly against each other. In between the stone blocks are earth and small stones filled in to close off any gaps. Ancient coins and portions of ceramic artifacts recovered near the walls date back to the 4th to 1st century BC, providing further confirmation of the age of the city ruin. The city seems to have existed until the beginning of the 1st century AD, which coincided with the end of the reign of Roman emperor Octavian Augustus. It was destroyed or abandoned during the Roman invasion.

Amauta,genus,wikipedia.org,"Amauta (meaning ""master"" or ""wise one"" in Quechua) was a title for teachers in the Inca Empire, especially of children of the nobility.
According to Fray Martin de Murua, a missionary in Peru, education in the Inca empire was instituted in schools called Yachaywasi or ""Houses of Knowledge"" in Cuzco. Students were children of the Inca nobility, the future rulers. The subjects were the moral standards, religion, government tenets, statistics, math, science, ""Runa-Simi"" language variety of Cuzco, Khipu interpretation, art, music construction, history, agronomy, architecture, medicine, philosophy and cosmological ideas of the earth and the universe, among other subjects.
The original Yachaywasi was constructed and inaugurated by Inca Roca. More schools like this were built as the empire grew, and were the centers of teaching the primary ideologies, histories, and philosophies of the empire. The amautas maintained this knowledge through an oral tradition and passed it on to the future generations. 
The word is still used in modern Perú, the communist, José Carlos Mariátegui ran a magazine named ""Amauta"".

Crambus,genus,wikipedia.org,"The genus Crambus includes around 155 species of moths in the family Crambidae, distributed globally. The adult stages are called crambid snout moths (a name shared with the rest of the family Crambidae, to distinguish them from Pyralidae snout moths), while the larvae of Crambus and the related genus Herpetogramma are the sod webworms, which can damage grasses.


== Life cycle ==

Sod webworms have a bivoltine life cycle with four stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago (adult). They overwinter as larvae in their final or penultimate instar in the thatch or soil. With the coming of warmer weather, the larvae will pupate, and moths will appear in late spring or early summer. The first generation of eggs is laid in June, with larvae appearing in June and lasting until July. Adult moths appear from July until August. Under favorable conditions, a second generation will occur, with the adult stage laying eggs in early October.


=== Egg ===
The eggs of Crambus species are dry and nonadhesive, with an oval to elliptical shape. The eggs of most species are white to creamy white when first laid, but later turn bright orange or red. The size of the eggs varies between species, but ranges from 0.3 mm to 0.6 mm.


=== Larva ===
The color of the larvae also varies from greenish to beige, brown, or gray, with most larvae having dark, circular spots that extend over the entire body. From the first instar to the third instar, the head capsule will appear black, but later instars have a light brown head capsule with various black sculpturation. At the first instar, the head capsule is 0.19–0.23 mm wide, growing to 1.23–2.21 mm by the last instar. The length of whole larva is 9–13 mm (0.4–0.5 in) at the first instar and 24–28 mm (0.9–1.1 in) at the last instar.
Crambus larvae, known as ""sod webworms"", feed primarily on grasses. In turfgrass species, their primary host plants are cool-season grasses, with fewer records on warm-season grasses. Some species also feed on maize, wheat, rye, oats, timothy-grass, and other grasses in pastures, and meadows, with the most damage occurring in areas with permanent sod. The damage caused is more pronounced during times of drought.


=== Pupa ===
The pupa develops in a silken cocoon attached to soil particles, plant debris and fecal pellets. The cocoon resembles a small lump of earth, while the pupa itself is pale yellow at first, darkening to a mahogany brown. The pupae are 8–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long by 2.5 mm (0.1 in) wide.


=== Imago ===
The adult moth is whitish or light gray to tan. Many species have patterns of colors, including silver, gold, yellow, brown and  black. The moths are approximately 12 mm (0.5 in) long, with wingspans of 20–25 mm (0.8–1.0 in). Like other snout moths, they have long labial palpi that extend in front of their heads, and fold their wings underneath their bodies, making them slender and harder to see while resting on plants.


== Damage ==
Sod webworms were first recognized as a serious pest of lawns and golf courses during the drought of 1928–1934 that affected most of the United States. Unlike many of the other more destructive turfgrass pests, the sod webworm is native to the United States and was not introduced.
Most damage occurs during the first instar, when the sod webworm only feeds on the foliage of the turfgrass. Damage is often seen as a small area of leaves that are yellow to brown. Sod webworms themselves will not be seen because of their nocturnal nature. During the day, the sod webworm can be found in its burrow in the center of the damaged area. Even though damage can be an eyesore, it does not hurt the turf because no damage is done to the crown of the plant. In closely mown turf and drought conditions, damage is more severe than in poorly maintained turf. In closely mown turf, symptoms will appear more quickly and prominently. During drought conditions, damage is more severe because the damage is often not seen until rainfall occurs.


=== Management ===
To be considered a serious infestation of sod webworms, 12 larvae must be found in a 0.1 square metres (1.1 sq ft) area. To test this, hollow pans are placed with a pyrethrum or detergent drench and allowed to sit for 10 minutes, then the larvae in the area are counted. During peak growing periods, the grass will often be able to recover by itself and not show serious damage. For high-end turf that cannot show any damage or serious infestations, predators of the sod webworms must be attracted, including birds and insect predators, such as ground beetles, robber flies, and predatory wasps. The larva is also prone to infection from microorganisms such as Beauveria bassiana and Nosema (Microsporidia). Parasitic nematodes such as Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis heliothidis can also infect sod webworms.


== Systematics and taxonomy ==
The genus Crambus was erected by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1798, and was originally used to cover species which are now considered to belong to the Noctuidae. The type species was designated by John Curtis in 1826 as Phalaena pascuella (now Crambus pascuella). Fabricius originally included 62 species, a number which had increased by 1940 to 116, of which only 98 were thought to be valid. A 1986 estimate suggested there were ""perhaps 400"" species of Crambus.
Species in the genus Crambus now are:

Blastobasis,genus,wikipedia.org,"Blastobasis is the type genus of the gelechioid moth family Blastobasidae; in some arrangements these are placed in the case-bearer family (Coleophoridae) as a subfamily. Within the Blastobasidae, the subfamily Blastobasinae (or tribe Blastobasini, if united with the concealer moths) has been established to distinguish the Blastobasis lineage from the group around Holcocera, but the delimitation is not yet well-resolved.
The monophyly of this genus – the largest of its family, containing at present about half the described Blastobasidae species – is seriously in doubt. Many presumed relatives have been separated in small or even monotypic genera, which may actually represent specialized lineages within the Blastobasis assemblage. On the other hand, some formerly-independent genera are usually included in Blastobasis at the moment. Agnoea, Auximobasis, Euresia and Zenodochium are sometimes included here but considered distinct by other authors.

Desmia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Desmia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Desmia is a genus of moths of the family Crambidae. The genus was erected by John O. Westwood in 1832.
The majority of species are found in South and Central America, though there are species in Africa, Asia, and North America. Most Desmia are small brown moths with variable white spots on the wings, although some such as Desmia flavalis are orange without white markings. Others, like Desmia filicornis, have a blue-green sheen. The end of the abdomen is often curved upward. The larvae are generally small leafroller caterpillars and some species, such as Desmia funeralis, are known to be agricultural pests on grapevines. Southern New World species may feed on wild coffee. Desmia species in North America are visually similar and often must be distinguished by DNA or genitalia.

== Distribution ==
Although the majority of species (including the type species A. matutinalis) placed in this genus are distributed in the Americas, three species are described from the Indomalayan and Australasian realms, namely A. adipalis, A. fatualis and A. geographicalis.


== Larval hostplants ==
The caterpillars of Ategumia are, as far as known, herbivores. Known hostplants are all in the Melastomataceae family: Melastoma malabathricum, M. ""deficidum"" (a misspelling of decemfidum?, which is a synonym of Melastoma sanguineum var. sanguineum), Miconia crenata and M. umbellata. Ategumia adipalis, A. ebulealis and A. fatualis were introduced to Hawaii for biological pest control to tackle Melastomataceae plants that have become invasive there.

Terastia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Terastia is a genus of snout moths in the subfamily Spilomelinae of the family Crambidae. It was described by Achille Guenée in 1854 with Terastia meticulosalis as type species. The genus is currently placed in the tribe Margaroniini, where it is closely related to the genera Agathodes and Liopasia.
Terastia with its eight species is distributed in the tropical regions of the Neotropical, Afrotropical and Oriental realm as well as Australasia.
Like the closely related genera Agathodes and Liopasia, the caterpillars of Terastia species feed on Erythrina species (Fabaceae).

Thyatira,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Thyatira,genus,wikipedia.org,"Thyateira (also Thyatira; Ancient Greek: Θυάτειρα) was the name of an ancient Greek city in Asia Minor, now the modern Turkish city of Akhisar (""white castle""), Manisa Province. The name is probably Lydian.  It lies in the far west of Turkey, southwest of Istanbul and east-northeast of Athens.  It is about 50 miles (80 km) from the Aegean Sea.


== History ==
It was an ancient Greek city called Pelopia (Ancient Greek: Πελόπεια) and Semiramis (Ancient Greek: Σεμίραμις), before it was renamed to Thyateira (Θυάτειρα), during the Hellenistic era in 290 BC, by the King Seleucus I Nicator. He was at war with Lysimachus when he learned that his wife had given birth to a daughter. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, he called this city ""Thuateira"" from Greek θυγάτηρ, θυγατέρα (thugatēr, thugatera), meaning ""daughter"", although it is likely that it is an older, Lydian name. In classical times, Thyatira stood on the border between Lydia and Mysia. During the Roman era, (1st century AD), it was famous for its dyeing facilities and was a center of the purple cloth trade. Among the ancient ruins of the city, inscriptions have been found relating to the guild of dyers in the city.  Indeed, more guilds συντεχνία suntechuia (syndicate) are known in Thyatira than any other contemporary city in the Roman province of Asia (inscriptions mention the following: wool-workers, linen-workers, makers of outer garments, dyers, leather-workers, tanners, potters, bakers, slave-dealers, and bronze-smiths).
In early Christian times, Thyateira was home to a significant Christian church, mentioned as one of the seven Churches of the Book of Revelation in the Book of Revelation. According to Revelation, a woman named Jezebel (who called herself a prophetess) taught and seduced the Christians of Thyateira to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. However, some commentators such as Benson and Doddridge have concluded that what is being here practised in Thyatira is the same apostasy promoted in Israel by Jezebel as mentioned in the Books of Kings and that use of her name here is a direct reference to such. Indeed, as Doddridge notes, ""the resemblance appears so great"" that, in his view, it is the ""same heresy which is represented"".
The Apostle Paul and Silas might have visited Thyateira during Paul's second or third journey, Acts 16:13–16. They visited several small unnamed towns in the general vicinity during the second journey. While in Philippi, Paul and Silas stayed with a woman named Lydia from Thyateira, who continued to help them even after they were jailed and released.
In 366, a battle fought near Thyateira saw the army of Roman emperor Valens defeat Roman usurper Procopius.


== Notable people ==
Artemidorus (Ancient Greek: Ἀρτεμίδωρος) of Thyateira was an athlete who won the Stadion race in the 193rd Olympiad (8 BC).
Nicander (Ancient Greek: Νίκανδρος), also known as Nicander of Thyateira (Ancient Greek: Νίκανδρος ὁ Θυατειρηνός) was an ancient Greek grammarian.
Lydia of Thyatira, businesswoman in the Acts of the Apostles chapter 16 verse 11–40.


== Bishopric ==

The city was home to a Christian community from the apostolic period. The community continued until 1922, when the Orthodox Christian population was deported.
In 1922, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople appointed an exarch for Western and Central Europe with the title Archbishop of Thyateira. The current archbishop of Thyateira (since 2019) is Nikitas Lulias. The Archbishop of Thyateira resides in London and has pastoral responsibility for the Greek Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta.
The see of Thyatira is also included, without archiepiscopal rank, in the Roman Catholic Church's list of titular sees.

Siga,genus,wikipedia.org,"Siga was a Berber and Roman port located near what is  now Aïn Témouchent, Algeria. Under the Roman Empire, it was part of western Mauretania Caesariensis, bordering Mauretania Tingitana.


== History ==
Siga was a major Mediterranean port in the ancient Kingdom of Numidia. It was located at the western border of the territory of the Masaesyli, a Berber tribe. Their traditional opponents were the Berber confederation of the Maesulians, who ruled the eastern portion.

In the course of the Second Punic War, King Syphax of the Masaesyli allied himself with the Roman Republic and the armies led by Scipio Africanus, while the Maesulians ruled by Masinissa sided with Carthage. With the defeat and capture of Syphax by Masinissa, the western tribes were conquered and gradually absorbed into a united kingdom under his rule. His successors minted coins at Siga with Punic script, in which its name appears as Shigan (𐤔𐤉𐤂𐤏𐤍, ŠYGʿN).

Some remains of buildings (of Siga) can be seen on a hill with a flat top in the lower valley of the Tafna at a bend of the river. A milestone found nearby names the site... A part of a necropolis on the plain has produced material of the 1st to 3d c. AD.
After a temporary decline, the city got some importance inside the Roman Africa, especially with African emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla. With the Arab conquest, during the second half of the seventh century, disappeared all references to Siga in documented history.
Number of visible or hidden monuments extend on both banks of the river Tafna (called ""Siga"" in Roman times) including the famous ""Numidian mausoleum"", the fortified acropolis and some Roman hydraulic and thermal facilities.


== Religion ==
The current Roman Catholic titular see of ""Sigus"" is probably based on this location, but there was another Sigus in western Numidia.

== Agricultural problems ==
The Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, is one of the biggest pests of maize in Asia, causing 10%-30% of yield losses in the field, and in some cases up to 80% yield loss. These pests carry fungal pathogens (such as Bipolaris maydis and Curvularia lunata) which cause diseases such as maydis leaf blight and curvularia leaf spot in the crop.

Aponia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Aponia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded 307 BCE based upon the teachings of Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus was an atomist and materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to religious skepticism and a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, and its main opponent later became Stoicism. It is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal. However, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from hedonism as colloquially understood.
Following the Cyrenaic philosopher Aristippus, Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of ataraxia (tranquility and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers generally withdrew from politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions that would conflict with their pursuit of virtue and peace of mind.
Few writings by Epicurus have survived. Diogenes Laertius has preserved three instructional letters attributed to Epicurus, as well as a list of the Principal Doctrines of Epicureanism. The letters to Herodotus and to Menoeceus are generally accepted as authentic works written by Epicurus himself. However, the letter addressed to Pythocles is often considered to be a compilation by one of his students, likely based on Epicurus’ original writings. There are also independent attestations of his ideas from his later disciples. The epic poem De rerum natura (Latin for ""On the Nature of Things"") by Lucretius presents the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism in one unified work. Many Epicurean texts have also been found on scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, mostly works written by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus or his teacher Zeno of Sidon along with fragments of works by Epicurus himself. Diogenes of Oenoanda, a wealthy Epicurean in the 2nd century CE, had a portico wall inscribed with tenets of the philosophy erected in Oenoanda, Lycia (present day Turkey). 
Epicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic period and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established in places such as Antioch, Alexandria, Rhodes, and Herculaneum. By the late 3rd century CE, Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly Neoplatonism) that were then in the ascent. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the Age of Enlightenment and continues in the modern era.


== History ==
Epicurus, the founder of the Epicurean School, was born in 342/1 BCE on the island of Samos. In his early years, he studied under Pamphilus, a Platonist philosopher in Samos. Later, he received instruction from Nausiphanes of Teos, a follower of Democritus. Although Epicurus would later downplay these early influences, it is generally acknowledged that Nausiphanes had a significant impact on the development of his thought. At the age of eighteen, Epicurus traveled to Athens for military service. After completing his duties, he devoted himself entirely to philosophy while living in Colophon. Epicurus taught and gained followers in Mytilene, the capital of the island Lesbos, and then in Lampsacus. In Athens, Epicurus bought a property for his school called ""Garden"", which later became the name of Epicurus' school. Its members included Hermarchus, Idomeneus, Colotes, Polyaenus, and Metrodorus. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly cosmopolitan by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Community activities held some importance, particularly the observance of Eikas, a monthly social gathering. Some members were also vegetarians as, from slight evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.
The school's popularity grew and it became, along with Stoicism, Platonism, Peripateticism, and Pyrrhonism, one of the dominant schools of Hellenistic philosophy, lasting strongly through the later Roman Empire. Deciphered carbonized scrolls obtained from the library at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum contain a large number of works by Philodemus, a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. Julius Caesar also leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against Catiline, during the Catiline conspiracy where he spoke out against the Stoic Cato. His father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, was also an adept of the school. In the 2nd century CE, comedian Lucian of Samosata and wealthy promoter of philosophy Diogenes of Oenoanda were prominent Epicureans.
After the death of Epicurus, leadership of the school passed to Hermarchus, who was originally from Mytilene. He was succeeded by Polystratus. Among Epicurus' closest students were Hermarchus, Polyaenus, and Metrodorus of Lampsacus. The Roman philosopher Cicero later wrote that he had listened to Phaedrus, who served as the head of the Athenian school around 90 BCE and had come to Rome. However, the most well-known follower of Epicureanism was the Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus (c. 91–51 BCE). Lucretius expressed Epicurus' philosophical ideas in his didactic poem De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things). The main goal of this work was to free people from the fear of the gods and death, and to guide them toward achieving inner peace and tranquility. 
By the late third century CE, however, there was little trace of its existence. 
With growing dominance of Neoplatonism and Peripateticism, and later, Christianity, Epicureanism declined.


== Philosophy ==


=== Physics ===
In his letter to Herodotus (not the historian), Epicurus presented three principles as to the nature of the physical world, i.e. that that which exists cannot come into being from that which does not exist, that which is destroyed does not cease to exist, and all that exists now always did exist and always will. The object of these principles was to establish the fact that all that constitutes the world is permanent and unchanging. Epicurean physics held that the entire universe consisted of two things: matter and void. Matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny bodies that have only the unchanging qualities of shape, size, and weight. The Epicureans believed that atoms were unchanging because the world was ordered and that changes had to have specific and consistent sources, e.g. a plant species only grows from a seed of the same species, but that in order for the universe to persist, what it is ultimately made up of must not be able to be changed or else the universe would be essentially destroyed.
Epicurus holds that there must be an infinite supply of atoms, although only a finite number of types of atoms, as well as an infinite amount of void. Epicurus explains this position in his letter to Herodotus:

Moreover, the sum of things is unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the extent of the void. For if the void were infinite and bodies finite, the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any supports or counterchecks to send them back on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be. Because of the infinite supply of atoms, there are an infinite number of worlds, or cosmoi. Some of these worlds could be vastly different from our own, some quite similar, and all of the worlds were separated from each other by vast areas of void (metakosmia).
Epicureanism states that atoms are unable to be broken down into any smaller parts because void is necessary for matter to move. Anything which consists of both void and matter can be broken down, while if something contains no void then it has no way to break apart because no part of the substance could be broken down into a smaller subsection of the substance. Atoms are constantly moving in one of four different ways. Atoms can simply collide with each other and then bounce off of each other. When joined with each other and forming a larger object, atoms can vibrate as they collide into each other while still maintaining the overall shape of the larger object.
When not prevented by other atoms, all atoms move at the same speed naturally downwards in relation to the rest of the world. This downwards motion is natural for atoms; however, as their fourth means of motion, atoms can at times randomly swerve out of their usual downwards path. This swerving motion is what allowed for the creation of the universe, since as more and more atoms swerved and collided with each other, objects were able to take shape as the atoms joined together. Without the swerve, the atoms would never have interacted with each other, and simply continued to move downwards at the same speed. Epicurus also felt that the swerve was what accounted for humanity's free will. If it were not for the swerve, humans would be subject to a never-ending chain of cause and effect. This was a point which Epicureans often used to criticize Democritus' atomic theory.


=== Epistemology ===
Epicurean philosophy employs an empirical epistemology, one based on the senses.


==== Sense perception ====
Epicureans believed that senses also relied on atoms. Every object was continually emitting particles from itself that would then interact with the observer. All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles. While the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations, e.g. red particles were not themselves red but  were emitted in a manner that caused the viewer to experience the color red. The atoms are not perceived individually, but rather as a continuous sensation because of how quickly they move.
The Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true, and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions. When we form judgments about things (hupolepsis), they can be verified and corrected through further sensory information. For example, if someone sees a tower from far away that appears to be round, and upon approaching the tower they see that it is actually square, they would come to realize that their original judgement was wrong and correct their wrong opinion.


==== Criterion of truth ====
Epicurus is said to have proposed three criteria of truth: sensations (aisthêsis), preconceptions (prolepsis), and feelings (pathê). A fourth criterion called ""presentational applications of the mind"" (phantastikai epibolai tês dianoias) was said to have been added by later Epicureans. These criteria formed the method through which Epicureans thought we gained knowledge.
Since Epicureans thought that sensations could not deceive, sensations are the first and main criterion of truth for Epicureans. Even in cases where sensory input seems to mislead, the input itself is true and the error arises from our judgments about the input. For example, when one places a straight oar in the water, it appears bent. The Epicurean would argue that the image of the oar, that is, the atoms traveling from the oar to the observer's eyes, has been shifted and thus really does arrive at the observer's eyes in the shape of a bent oar. The observer makes the error in assuming that the image he or she receives correctly represents the oar and has not been distorted in some way. In order to not make erroneous judgments about perceivable things and instead verify one's judgment, Epicureans believed that one needed to obtain ""clear vision"" (enargeia) of the perceivable thing by closer examination. This acted as a justification for one's judgements about the thing being perceived. Enargeia is characterized as sensation of an object that has been unchanged by judgments or opinions and is a clear and direct perception of that object.
An individual's preconceptions are his or her concepts of what things are, e.g. what someone's idea of a horse is, and these concepts are formed in a person's mind through sensory input over time. When the word that relates to the preconception is used, these preconceptions are summoned up by the mind into the person's thoughts. It is through our preconceptions that we are able to make judgments about the things that we perceive. Preconceptions were also used by Epicureans to avoid the paradox proposed by Plato in the Meno regarding learning. Plato argues that learning requires us to already have knowledge of what we are learning, or else we would be unable to recognize when we had successfully learned the information. Preconceptions, Epicureans argue, provide individuals with that pre-knowledge required for learning.
Our feelings or emotions (pathê) are how we perceive pleasure and pain. They are analogous to sensations in that they are a means of perception, but they perceive our internal state as opposed to external things. According to Diogenes Laertius, feelings are how we determine our actions. If something is pleasurable, we pursue that thing, and if something is painful, we avoid that thing.
The idea of ""presentational applications of the mind"" is an explanation for how we can discuss and inquire about things we cannot directly perceive. We receive impressions of such things directly in our minds, instead of perceiving them through other senses. The concept of ""presentational applications of the mind"" may have been introduced to explain how we learn about things that we cannot directly perceive, such as the gods.


=== Ethics ===

Epicureanism bases its ethics on a hedonistic set of values, seeing pleasure as the chief good in life. Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one's lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure.  Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether. He viewed recreational sex as a natural, but not necessary, desire that should be generally avoided. Since the political life could give rise to desires that could disturb virtue and one's peace of mind, such as a lust for power or a desire for fame, participation in politics was discouraged. Further, Epicurus sought to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death, seeing those two fears as chief causes of strife in life.


==== Pleasure ====
When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.
Epicureans had a very specific understanding of what the greatest pleasure was, and the focus of their ethics was on the avoidance of pain rather than seeking out pleasure. As evidence for this, Epicureans say that nature seems to command us to avoid pain, and they point out that all animals try to avoid pain as much as possible. Epicureanism divided pleasure into two broad categories: pleasures of the body and pleasures of the mind. Pleasures of the body involve sensations of the body, such as the act of eating delicious food or of being in a state of comfort free from pain, and exist only in the present. One can only experience pleasures of the body in the moment, meaning they only exist as a person is experiencing them. Pleasures of the mind involve mental processes and states; feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind. These pleasures of the mind do not only exist in the present, but also in the past and future, since memory of a past pleasant experience or the expectation of some potentially pleasing future can both be pleasurable experiences. Because of this, the pleasures of the mind are considered to be greater than those of the body.
Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures. The Epicureans further divided each of these types of pleasures into two categories: kinetic pleasure and katastematic pleasure. Absence of pain, aponia, and lack of disturbance of mind, ataraxia, are two of the katastematic pleasures and often seen as the focal ones to Epicurus. Kinetic pleasure is the physical or mental pleasures that involve action or change. Eating delicious food, as well as fulfilling desires and removing pain, which is itself considered a pleasurable act, are all examples of kinetic pleasure in the physical sense. According to Epicurus, feelings of joy would be an example of mental kinetic pleasure. Katastematic pleasure is the pleasure one feels while in a state without pain. Like kinetic pleasures, katastematic pleasures can also be physical, such as the state of not being thirsty, or mental, such as freedom from a state of fear.
While the pursuit of pleasure formed the focal point of the philosophy, this was largely directed to the ""static pleasures"" of minimizing pain, anxiety and suffering. From this understanding, Epicureans concluded that the greatest pleasure a person could reach was the complete removal of all pain, both physical and mental. The ultimate goal then of Epicurean ethics was to reach a state of aponia and ataraxia.


==== Desire ====
I learn that your bodily inclination leans most keenly towards sexual intercourse. If you neither violate the laws nor disturb well established morals nor sadden someone close to you, nor strain your body, nor spend what is needed for necessities, use your own choice as you wish. It is sure difficult to imagine, however, that none of these would be a part of sex because sex never benefitted anyone.
In order to do this an Epicurean had to control their desires, because desire itself was seen as painful. Not only will controlling one's desires bring about aponia, as one will rarely suffer from not being physically satisfied, but controlling one's desires will also help to bring about ataraxia because one will not be anxious about becoming discomforted since one would have so few desires anyway. The Epicureans divide desires into three classes: natural and necessary, natural but not necessary, and vain and empty:

Natural and necessary: These desires are limited desires that are innately present in all humans; it is part of human nature to have them. They are necessary for one of three reasons: necessary for happiness, necessary for freedom from bodily discomfort, and necessary for life. Clothing and shelter would belong to the first two categories, while something like food would belong to the third.
Natural but not necessary: These desires are innate to humans, but they do not need to be fulfilled for their happiness or their survival. Wanting to eat delicious food when one is hungry is an example of a natural but not necessary desire. The main problem with these desires is that they fail to substantially increase a person's happiness, and at the same time require effort to obtain and are desired by people due to false beliefs that they are actually necessary. It is for this reason that they should be avoided.
Vain and empty: These desires are neither innate to humans nor required for happiness or health; indeed, they are also limitless and can never be fulfilled. Desires of wealth or fame would fall in this class, and such desires are to be avoided because they will ultimately only bring about discomfort.
If one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach aponia and ataraxia and thereby the highest form of happiness. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially produced desires were to be suppressed.


==== Politics ====
It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life. 
The Epicurean understanding of justice was inherently self-interested. Justice was deemed good because it was seen as mutually beneficial. Individuals would not act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished. Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause a person disturbance and prevent them from being happy.
Epicurus was also an early thinker to develop the notion of justice as a social contract, and in part attempts to address issues with the society described in Plato's Republic. The social contract theory established by Epicureanism is based on mutual agreement, not divine decree. He defined justice as an agreement made by people not to harm each other. The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness. Because of this, laws that do not contribute to promoting human happiness are not just. He gave his own unique version of the ethic of reciprocity, which differs from other formulations by emphasizing minimizing harm and maximizing happiness for oneself and others.
Epicurean ideas on politics disagree with other philosophical traditions, namely the Stoic, Platonist and Aristotelian traditions. To Epicureans all our social relations are a matter of how we perceive each other, of customs and traditions. No one is inherently of higher value or meant to dominate another. That is because there is no metaphysical basis for the superiority of one kind of person, all people are made of the same atomic material and are thus naturally equal. Epicureans also discourage political participation and other involvement in politics. However Epicureans are not apolitical, it is possible that some political association could be seen as beneficial by some Epicureans. Some political associations could lead to certain benefits to the individual that would help to maximize pleasure and avoid physical or mental distress.


==== Friendship ====
of all the things which wisdom has contrived which contribute to a blessed life, none is more important, more fruitful, than friendship
Epicurus laid great emphasis on developing friendships as the basis of a satisfying life. The avoidance or freedom from hardship and fear is ideal to the Epicureans. While this avoidance or freedom could conceivably be achieved through political means, it was insisted by Epicurus that involvement in politics would not release one from fear and he advised against a life of politics. Epicurus also discouraged contributing to political society by starting a family, as the benefits of a wife and children are outweighed by the trouble brought about by having a family. Instead Epicurus encouraged a formation of a community of friends outside the traditional political state. This community of virtuous friends would focus on internal affairs and justice. However, Epicureanism is adaptable to circumstance as is the Epicurean approach to politics. The same approaches will not always work in protection from pain and fear. In some situations it will be more beneficial to have a family and in other situations it will be more beneficial to participate in politics. It is ultimately up to the Epicurean to analyse their circumstance and take whatever action befits the situation.


==== Death ====
Epicureanism rejects immortality. It believes in the soul, but suggests that the soul is mortal and material, just like the body. Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: ""Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."" From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo (""I was not; I have been; I am not; I do not mind.""), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the Roman Empire.


==== Gods ====
Epicureanism does not deny the existence of the gods; rather it denies their involvement in the world. According to Epicureanism, the gods do not interfere with human lives or the rest of the universe in any way – thus, it shuns the idea that frightening weather events are divine retribution. One of the fears the Epicurean ought to be freed from is fear relating to the actions of the gods.
The manner in which the Epicurean gods exist is still disputed. Some scholars say that Epicureanism believes that the gods exist outside the mind as material objects (the realist position), while others assert that the gods only exist in our minds as ideals (the idealist position). The realist position holds that Epicureans understand the gods as existing as physical and immortal beings made of atoms that reside somewhere in reality. However, the gods are completely separate from the rest of reality; they are uninterested in it, play no role in it, and remain completely undisturbed by it. Instead, the gods live in what is called the metakosmia, or the space between worlds. Contrarily, the idealist (sometimes called the ""non-realist position"" to avoid confusion) position holds that the gods are just idealized forms of the best human life, and it is thought that the gods were emblematic of the life one should aspire towards. The debate between these two positions was revived by A. A. Long and David Sedley in their 1987 book, The Hellenistic Philosophers, in which the two argued in favour of the idealist position. While a scholarly consensus has yet to be reached, the realist position remains the prevailing viewpoint at this time.


== Epicurean writings ==


=== On Nature ===
On Nature (Ancient Greek: Περὶ φύσεως) is the name of a philosophical treatise in 37 books consisting of lectures written by Epicurus, which can be considered his main work, however, it has mostly been lost. Some excerpts have survived compiled from burnt papyri scrolls found in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. Most of the surviving papyri are kept in the National Library of Naples. Important parts of Book II are preserved in the British Museum.
Since most of the 37 books ""On Nature"" are lost, the Principal Doctrines and Epicurus' Letters to Herodotus, Menoeceus, and Pythocles are the most authoritative writings on Epicureanism. Similarly, Lucretius' poem De rerum natura probably follows Epicurus' work.


=== Principal doctrines ===

The Principal Doctrines are forty authoritative conclusions set up as official doctrines by Epicurus, Metrodorus of Lampsacus, Hermarchus of Mitilene and Polyaenus of Lampsacus.  The Principal Doctrines exemplify the Epicurean philosophers' practice of publishing summaries and outlines of their teachings for easy memorization. However, they are so concise and short that it's difficult to understand them in depth without the context of additional commentaries and writings by ancient sources or by modern Epicurean practitioners, whenever possible. They are often cited as ""PDs"" in English.
Some of the Principal Doctrines are organized into groups and are meant to be studied together. The first four doctrines make up the Tetrapharmakos (Four Cures). PD's 10-13 discuss the Epicurean philosophy of science. PD's 18-21 explain the natural limits of desires and in time, and how the flesh is unable to learn these limits but the mind can. PD's 22-25 deal with the importance of the canon, or the Epicurean standard of truth. PD's 31-38 explain the Epicurean doctrines on justice based on mutual advantage and contractarianism. PD's 39-40 call for an intimate society of friends.


==== Tetrapharmakos ====

Tetrapharmakos, or ""The four-part cure"", is Philodemus of Gadara's basic guideline as to how to live the happiest possible life, based on the first four of the doctrines. This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus' philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:

Don't fear god,Don't worry about death;What is good is easy to get, andWhat is terrible is easy to endure.


=== Letters of Epicurus ===
Three letters of Epicurus are preserved by Diogenes Laertius.


==== Letter to Herodotus ====
Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus (not the historian) was written as an introduction to Epicurean philosophy and method of studying nature. It included the most complete detail of the ancient conversations that led to the development of atomist theory, a doctrine of innumerable worlds, and an explanation of the phenomenon of time that posits an early form of relativism. Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus appears to be a summary of On Nature, books I–XIII.


==== Letter to Pythocles ====
Epicurus' Letter to Pythocles is the second letter preserved by Diogenes Laertius in The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. In Letter to Pythocles, Epicurus treats the things for which there is uncertainty in how they occur. His train of thought is explicated through meteorological phenomena: various weather events as well as celestial phenomena in space such as asteroids, the creation and destruction of cosmoi, and the paths of planetary bodies through space. In Epicurus' time, long before any modern technological advances such as microscopes or telescopes which allow us to establish greater knowledge of these phenomena, these were all examples of things that, as far as the limits of human knowledge extended, it was impossible to establish certainty with regards to their causes, or how they occurred. Epicurus elaborates on how one may reason regarding such things so as to come to reasonable conclusions without undue certainty, so as to maintain Ataraxia.


==== Letter to Menoeceus ====
Epicurus' Letter to Menoeceus is a summary of his ethical teachings written in the epistolary literary style, and addressed to a student. It addresses theology, the hierarchies of desires, how to carry choices and avoidances in order to achieve net pleasure, and other aspects of Epicurean ethics.


=== Epicurea ===
The Epicurea is a collection of texts, fragments, and testimonies by Epicurus that was collected by Hermann Usener in 1887. This work features a collection of writings by Epicurus that explain the values and beliefs of Ancient Epicurian philosophy.


=== Other ancient testimonies ===
One of the earliest Roman writers espousing Epicureanism was Amafinius, although his work has not survived. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included Lucretius, who wrote the poem De rerum natura about the tenets of the philosophy. The Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as much of his work, along with other Epicurean material such as the lectures of Zeno of Sidon, was discovered in the Villa of the Papyri.  Another major source of information is the Roman politician and philosopher Cicero, although he was highly critical, denouncing the Epicureans as unbridled hedonists, devoid of a sense of virtue and duty, and guilty of withdrawing from public life. Another ancient source is Diogenes of Oenoanda, who composed a large inscription at Oenoanda in Lycia.  Diogenes Laërtius reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus' opponents.


== Legacy ==


=== Later antiquity ===
The early Christian writer Lactantius criticizes Epicurus at several points throughout his Divine Institutes and preserves the Riddle of Epicurus, or Problem of evil, a famous argument against the existence of an all-powerful and providential God or gods. This type of trilemma argument (God is omnipotent, God is good, but Evil exists) was one favoured by the ancient Greek skeptics, and this argument may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an atheist. According to Reinhold F. Glei, it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not Epicurean, but even anti-Epicurean. The earliest extant version of this trilemma appears in the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus.
Epikoros is a Jewish term figuratively meaning ""a heretic"", cited in the Mishnah, referring to one who does not have a share in the world to come Although rabbinic literature does not make any specific reference to the Greek philosopher Epicurus, it is apparent that the term is derived from the philosopher's name, in reference to his views which contradicted Jewish scripture, the strictly monotheistic conception of God in Judaism and the Jewish belief in the world to come.


=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
In Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, the Epicureans are depicted as heretics suffering in the sixth circle of hell. In fact, Epicurus appears to represent the ultimate heresy.
Francis Bacon wrote an apothegm related to Epicureanism:

There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons, but capons could never be made cocks.  
This echoed what the Academic skeptic philosopher Arcesilaus had said when asked ""why it was that pupils from all the other schools went over to Epicurus, but converts were never made from the Epicureans?"" to which he responded: ""Because men may become eunuchs, but a eunuch never becomes a man.""


=== Modern revival ===
In the 17th century, the French Franciscan priest, scientist and philosopher Pierre Gassendi wrote two books forcefully reviving Epicureanism. Shortly thereafter, and clearly influenced by Gassendi, Walter Charleton published several works on Epicureanism in English. Attacks by Christians continued, most forcefully by the Cambridge Platonists.

In modern times Thomas Jefferson referred to himself as an Epicurean:If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.Other modern-day Epicureans were Gassendi, Walter Charleton, François Bernier, Saint-Évremond, Ninon de l'Enclos, Denis Diderot, Frances Wright and Jeremy Bentham.
In France, where perfumer/restaurateur Gérald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean, Michel Onfray is developing a post-modern approach to Epicureanism. In his 2011 book titled The Swerve, Stephen Greenblatt identified himself as strongly sympathetic to Epicureanism and Lucretius. Humanistic Judaism as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.


=== Similarities with eastern philosophies ===
Some scholars have drawn parallels between Epicureanism and some eastern philosophies that similarly emphasize atomism or a lack of divine interference, such as Jainism, Charvaka, and Buddhism. Epicureanism also resembles Buddhism in its belief that great excess leads to great dissatisfaction.


=== Misconceptions ===
In modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; Epicureanism implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.
Because Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (telos), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ataraxia (tranquility, freedom from fear) and aponia (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia. Yet Epicurus referred ""the good"", and ""even wisdom and culture"", to the ""pleasure of the stomach"".
While Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. Called ""The Garden"" for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its Eikas (Greek εἰκάς from εἴκοσῐ eíkosi, ""twenty""), feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month), which was otherwise considered sacred to the god Apollo, and also corresponding to the final day of the rites of initiation to the mysteries of Demeter.

Psara,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Psara,genus,wikipedia.org,"Psara (Greek: Ψαρά, Psará, [psaˈra]; known in ancient times as Ψύρα/Ψυρίη, Psyra/Psyriē) is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea. Together with the small island of Antipsara (population 4) it forms the municipality of Psara. It is part of the Chios regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The only town of the island and seat of the municipality is also called Psara.
Psara had 420 inhabitants according to the 2021 census. It has a small port linking to the island of Chios and other parts of Greece.
In the Psara massacre on the island, thousands of Greeks were massacred by Ottoman troops during the Greek War of Independence in 1824.


== Geography ==

Psara lies 81 km (50 mi) northwest of Chios, 22 km (14 miles) from the northwestern point of the island of Chios and 150 km (93 mi) east-northeast of Athens. The length and width of the island are about 7 by 8 km (4 by 5 mi) and the area is 43 km2 (17 sq mi). The highest point on the island is ""Profitis Ilias"" (512 m (1,680 ft)). The municipality has total area of 44.511 km2 (17.186 sq mi).


== Flag ==
The modern flag of Psara is based largely on the island's famous revolutionary flag created by Psariot locals in 1824. The original flag, carried during the War of Independence by Psariot ships, was made of white cloth bordered with red. It bore the symbols of Filiki Eteria in red (a large cross atop a crescent, a spear, and an anchor). A snake was wrapped around the anchor, often depicted with a bird flying near its mouth. On either side of the Filiki Eteria symbols, in red capital letters, were the words ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ Η ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ (FREEDOM OR DEATH) and in some cases, the island's name, spelled ΨΑ–ΡΑ or ΨΑΡ–ΡΑ. An original 1824 flag of Psara is preserved at the National Historical Museum of Greece.

The flag of Psara currently in use has a very similar design but omits the island's name and bears a star below the crescent.


== History ==
Psara has been inhabited since the Mycenaean period, its inhabitants relying on the sea to make a living as the island is treeless and rocky with little shrubbery.
Homer, Strabo, Cratinus, Suda and Stephanus of Byzantium referred to the island as Psyra (Ancient Greek: Ψυρά and Ψύρα) and Psyrian (Ancient Greek: Ψυρίαν).
The island had a city also called Psyra.
The islanders' sole source of livelihood has always been fishing, mainly for the locally abundant slipper lobsters, and shipping, with some tourist development in recent years.
The Greek ancient proverb Psyra celebrating Dionysos (Ancient Greek: Ψύρα τὸν Διόνυσον ἄγοντες) originated from the fact that Psyra was a poor and small island which could not produce its own wine, and was used in reference to people who were reclining at a symposium but not drinking. Another ancient Greek proverb, You regard Sparta as Psyra (Ancient Greek: Ψύρα τε τὴν Σπάρτην ἄγεις), also expressed the poverty of the island.
During the Middle Ages Psara had a very small population, which abandoned the island for Chios after the Fall of Constantinople. Between the 14th and second half of the 15th century, a small group of Albanians settled on the island and developed an Arvanite community, but it was quickly assimilated into the local Greek population. In the 16th century, under the Ottoman rule, the Psariots who had previously left, returned to their homeland along with other settlers and established a settlement around the Palaiokastro fort which they repaired. They turned to trade, amassing great profits. By the beginning of the 19th century the Psariots had the third largest trade fleet in Greece after Hydra and Spetses, numbering some 45 ships.


== Destruction ==

Psara joined the Greek War of Independence on April 10, 1821. Future Prime Minister Konstantinos Kanaris, Dimitrios Papanikolis, Andreas Pipinos and Nikolis Apostolis distinguished themselves as naval leaders, using fire ships to combat the more powerful Ottoman Navy. Psara's native population of 7,500 people was further augmented by 23,000 refugees from Thessaly, Macedonia, Chios, Moschonisia and Kydonies.
On July 3 (June 21 O.S.), 1824, the island was invaded by the Turks. The resistance of the Psariots ended the next day with a last stand at the town's old fort of Palaiokastro (alternative name Mavri Rachi, literally ""black ridge""). Hundreds of soldiers and also women and children had taken refuge there when an Ottoman force of 2,000 stormed the fort. The refugees first threw a white flag with the words ""Ἐλευθερία ἤ Θάνατος"" (""Eleftheria i Thanatos"", ""Freedom or Death""). Then, the moment the Turks entered the fort, the local Antonios Vratsanos lit a fuse to the gunpowder stock, in an explosion that killed the town's inhabitants along with their enemies — thus remaining faithful to their flag to their death. A French officer who heard and saw the explosion compared it to a volcanic eruption of Vesuvius.
A part of the population managed to flee the island, but those who did not were either sold into slavery or killed. As a result of the invasion, thousands of Greeks met a tragic fate. The island was deserted and surviving islanders were scattered through what is now Southern Greece. Theophilos Kairis, a priest and scholar, took on many of the orphaned children and developed the famous school the Orphanotropheio of Theophilos Kairis. Psara remained in the hands of the Ottomans until it was recaptured by the Greek navy on 21 October 1912 during the First Balkan War.


== Historical population ==

A native of Psara is known in English as a Psariot or a Psarian.


== Notable people ==

Notable natives and inhabitants of the island include:

Ioannis Varvakis (1745–1825), admiral, caviar merchant and benefactor.
Nikolis Apostolis (1770–1827), admiral.
Dimitrios Papanikolis (1790–1855), admiral.
Konstantinos Kanaris (1793/1795–1877), admiral and politician, Prime Minister of Greece.
Garafilia Mohalbi (1817–1830), Greek-American refugee and former slave.
George Sirian (1818–1891), United States Navy officer.

Carales,genus,wikipedia.org,"Cagliari (, also UK: , US: ; Italian: [ˈkaʎʎari] ; Sardinian: Casteddu [kasˈteɖːu]; Latin: Caralis) is an Italian municipality and the capital and largest city of the island of Sardinia, an autonomous region of Italy. It has about 146,627 inhabitants, while its metropolitan city, 16 other nearby municipalities, has about 417,079 inhabitants. According to Eurostat, the population of the functional urban area, the commuting zone of Cagliari, rises to 476,975. Cagliari is the 26th largest city in Italy and the largest city on the island of Sardinia.
An ancient city with a long history, Cagliari has seen the rule of several civilisations. Under the buildings of the modern city there is a continuous stratification attesting to human settlement over the course of some five thousand years, from the Neolithic to today. Historical sites include the prehistoric Domus de Janas, very damaged by cave activity, a large Carthaginian era necropolis, a Roman era amphitheatre, a Byzantine basilica, three Pisan-era towers and a strong system of fortification that made the town the core of Spanish Habsburg imperial power in the western Mediterranean Sea. Its natural resources have always been its sheltered harbour, the often powerfully fortified hill of Castel di Castro, the modern Casteddu, the salt from its lagoons, and, from the hinterland, wheat from the Campidano plain and silver and other ores from the Iglesiente mines.
Cagliari was the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1324 to 1848, when Turin became the formal capital of the kingdom (which in 1861 became the Kingdom of Italy). Today the city is a regional cultural, educational, political and artistic centre, known for its diverse Art Nouveau architecture and several monuments. It is also Sardinia's economic and industrial hub, having one of the biggest ports in the Mediterranean Sea, an international airport, and the 106th highest income level in Italy (among 8,092 comuni), comparable to that of several northern Italian cities.
It is also the seat of the University of Cagliari, founded in 1607, and of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cagliari, since the 5th century AD.


== History ==


=== Early history ===

The Cagliari area has been inhabited since the Neolithic. It occupies a favourable position between the sea and a fertile plain and is surrounded by two marshes (which provides defence against attacks from the inland). There are high mountains nearby, to which people could evacuate if the settlement had to be given up. Relics of prehistoric inhabitants were found in the hill of Monte Claro (Monte Claro culture) and in Cape Sant'Elia (several domus de janas).

Karaly (Punic: 𐤊𐤓𐤋‬𐤉, KRLY) was established around the 8th/7th century BC as one of a string of Phoenician colonies in Sardinia, including Tharros. The etymology of the toponym is unknown. It almost certainly does not come from the Phoenician language, but it has some similarities with other Sardinian or Asia Minor toponyms. Its founding is linked to its position along communication routes with Africa as well as to its excellent port. The Phoenician settlement was located in the Stagno di Santa Gilla, west of the present centre of Cagliari. This was also the site of the Roman Portus Scipio, and when Arab pirates raided the area in the 8th century it became the refuge for people fleeing from the city. Other Phoenician settlements have been found at Cape Sant'Elia.
In the late 6th century BC Carthage took control of part of Sardinia, and Cagliari grew substantially under its domination, as testified by the large Tuvixeddu necropolis and other remains. Cagliari was a fortified settlement in what is now the modern Marina quarter, with an annexed holy area in the modern Stampace.
Sardinia and Cagliari came under Roman rule in 238 BC, shortly after the First Punic War, when the Romans defeated the Carthaginians. No mention of it is found on the occasion of the Roman conquest of the island but, during the Second Punic War, Caralis was the headquarters of the praetor, Titus Manlius Torquatus, whence he conducted his operations against Hampsicora and the Carthaginians. At other times it was also the Romans' chief naval station on the island and the residence of its praetor.
The Romans built a new settlement east of the old Punic city, the vicus munitus Caralis (i.e. the fortified community of Caralis) mentioned by Varro Atacinus. The two urban agglomerations merged gradually during the second century BC; to this process is perhaps attributable the plural name Carales.
Florus calls it the urbs urbium or capital of Sardinia. He represents it as taken and severely punished by Gracchus, but this statement is wholly at variance with Livy's account of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes. In the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, the citizens of Caralis were the first to declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia; and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa. A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of Menas, the lieutenant of Sextus Pompeius, Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.
Cagliari continued to be regarded as the capital of the island under the Roman Empire, and though it did not become a colony, obtained the status of municipium.
Remains of Roman public buildings were found to the west of Marina in Piazza del Carmine. There was an area of ordinary housing near the modern Via Roma, and richer houses on the slopes of the Marina distinct. The amphitheatre is located to the west of the Castello.
A Christian community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, and by the end of that century the city had a Christian bishop. In the middle decades of the 4th century bishop Lucifer of Cagliari was exiled because of his opposition to the sentence against Athanasius of Alexandria at the Synod of Milan. He was banished to the desert of Thebais by the emperor Constantius II.
Claudian describes the ancient city of Karalis as extending to a considerable length towards the promontory or headland, the projection of which sheltered its port. The port affords good anchorage for large vessels, but besides this, which is only a well-sheltered standby, there is a large salt-water lake or lagoon, called the Stagno di Cagliari, adjoining the city and communicating by a narrow channel with the bay, which appears from Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin. The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy (Κάραλις πόλις καὶ ἄκρα), but the Caralitanum Promontorium of Pliny can be no other than the headland, now called Capo Carbonara, which forms the eastern boundary of the Gulf of Cagliari and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria, now called the Isola dei Cavoli (""Cabbage Island"" in Italian, Isula de is Càvurus ""Crab Island"" in Sardinian).
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire Cagliari fell, together with the rest of Sardinia, into the hands of the Vandals, but appears to have retained its importance throughout the Middle Ages.


=== Judicate of Cagliari ===

Subsequently, ruled by the Vandals, Ostrogoths, and then part of the Byzantine Empire, Cagliari became the capital of a gradually independent Judicate, (from Latin Iudex, Governor and Supreme Magistrate, used in late Roman and Byzantine period, along with the medieval Greek ἄρχων). This state was born around 1020 and was overthrown by the Republic of Pisa in 1258. Due to the overlap of buildings since the year 800 B.C., and the scarcity of archeological and historical informations, it was believed that the population was moved to more inland areas of the territory, along the lagoon, in a city called Santa Ilia or Santa Igia (modern San Gilla) and it was believed that the ancient Roman and Byzantine city had been abandoned because it was too exposed to attacks by Moorish pirates coming from north Africa and Spain. Recent studies have instead hypothesized that the capital of the Giudicato was located around the road that it directed towards Sassari, today called Corso Vittorio Emanuele II (in Sardinian language: Su Brugu, the borough), although there are not yet archeological confirmations, particularly of the Cathedral and the Judex Palace, destroyed after the Pisan conquest. The Judicate of Cagliari comprised a large area of the Campidano plain, the Sulcis-Iglesiente and the mountain region of Ogliastra.


=== 11th to 13th century ===

During the 11th century, the Republic of Pisa began to extend its political influence over the Judgedom of Cagliari. Pisa and the maritime republic of Genoa had a keen interest in Sardinia because it was a perfect strategic base for controlling the commercial routes between Italy and North Africa.
In 1215 the Pisan Lamberto Visconti, husband of Elena of Gallura, forced the judikessa Benedetta of Cagliari to give him the mount located east of Santa Igia. Soon (1216–17) Pisan merchants established there a new fortified city, known as Castel di Castro, which can be considered the ancestor of the modern city of Cagliari.
In 1258, after the defeat of William III, the last king of Cagliari, the Pisans and their Sardinian allies (Arborea, Gallura and Logudoro) destroyed the old capital of Santa Igia. The Judgedom of Cagliari was then divided into three parts: the northeast third went to Gallura; the central portion was incorporated into Arborea; Sulcis and Iglesiente, on the southwest, were given to the Pisan della Gherardesca family, while the Republic of Pisa maintained control over its colony of Castel di Castro.
Some of the fortifications that still surround the current district of Castello were built by the Pisans, including the two remaining white limestone towers (early 14th century) designed by the architect Giovanni Capula. Together with the district of Castello, Castel di Castro comprised the districts of Marina (which included the port), and later Stampace and Villanova. Marina and Stampace were guarded by walls, in contrast to Villanova, which was mostly home to peasants.


=== 14th to 17th centuries ===

In the second decade of the 14th century the Crown of Aragon conquered Sardinia after a series of battles against the Pisans. During the siege of Castel di Castro (1324-1326), the Aragonese, led by Alfonso IV of Aragon, built a stronghold on a more southern hill, that of Bonaria.

When the fortified city was finally conquered by the Aragonese army, Castel di Castro (Castell de Càller or simply Càller in Catalan) became the administrative capital of the newborn Kingdom of Sardinia, one of the many kingdoms forming the Crown of Aragon, which later came under the rule of the Spanish Empire. After the expulsion of the Tuscans, the Castello district was repopulated by the Aragonese settlers of Bonaria while the indigenous population was, as in the past, concentrated in Stampace and Villanova.
The kings of Sardinia, also kings of Aragon and later kings of Spain, were represented in Cagliari by a viceroy, who resided in the Palazzo Regio.

In the 16th century the fortifications of the city were strengthened with the construction of the bastions and the rights and benefits of the Aragonese were extended to all citizens. The intellectual life was relatively lively and in the early years of the 17th century the university was founded.


=== 18th century ===
In 1718, after a brief rule by the Habsburgs, Cagliari and Sardinia came under the House of Savoy. As rulers of Sardinia, the Savoys took the title of kings of the Sardinian kingdom. During the Savoyard Era, until 1848, the institutions of the Sardinian kingdom remained unchanged, but with the ""Perfect Fusion"" in that year, all the possessions of the House of Savoy House, comprising Savoy, Nice (now part of France), Piedmont and from 1815 Liguria, were merged into a unitary state. Although Sardinian by name, the kingdom had its parliament in Turin, where the Savoys resided, and its members were mainly aristocrats from Piedmont or the mainland.
In the late 18th century during the French Revolutionary Wars France tried to conquer Cagliari because of its strategic role in the Mediterranean sea (Expédition de Sardaigne). A French army landed on Poetto beach and advanced towards Cagliari, but the French were defeated by Sardinians who had decided to defend themselves against the revolutionary army. The people of Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the Savoys in return for their defence of the town. For example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the parliament of the kingdom. When the Savoyards refused any concession to the Sardinians, the inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against them and expelled all the representatives of the kingdom along with the Piedmontese rulers. This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during Sa die de sa Sardigna (""The day of Sardinia"") on the last weekend of April. However, the Savoys regained control of the town after a brief period of autonomous rule.


=== Modern age ===

The population by the 1840s had reached 29,000. Starting in the 1870s, in the wake of the unification of Italy, the city experienced a century of rapid growth. Numerous buildings combined influences from Art Nouveau together with the traditional Sardinian taste for floral decoration; an example is the white marble City Hall near the port. Many buildings were erected by the end of the 19th century during the term of office of mayor Ottone Bacaredda.  In 1905 he had to face up to the a violent, bloody revolt against the exorbitant cost of living, stoked by his political opponents and which caused a number of victims and extensive material damage. After various other ups and downs, and following another resignation, he was returned to office between 1911 and 1917. Ottone Bacaredda died in his modest house in Via San Giovanni, on 26 December 1921,
During the Second World War Cagliari was heavily bombed by the Allies in February 1943. In order to escape from the danger of bombardments and difficult living conditions, many people were evacuated from the city into the countryside. In total the victims of the bombings were more than 2000 and about 80% of the buildings were damaged. The city received the Gold Medal of Military Valour.
After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the German Army took control of Cagliari and the island, but soon retreated peacefully in order to reinforce their positions in mainland Italy. The American Army then took control of Cagliari. Airports near the city (Elmas, Monserrato, Decimomannu, currently a NATO airbase) were used by Allied aircraft to fly to North Africa or mainland Italy and Sicily.
After the war, the population of Cagliari grew again and many apartment blocks and recreational areas were erected in new residential districts.

== Geography ==

And suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep, golden-looking, piled naked to the sky from the plain at the head of the formless hollow bay. It is strange and rather wonderful, not a bit like Italy. The city piles up lofty and almost miniature, and makes me think of Jerusalem: without trees, without cover, rising rather bare and proud, remote as if back in history, like a town in a monkish, illuminated missal. One wonders how it ever got there. And it seems like Spain—or Malta: not Italy. It is a steep and lonely city, treeless, as in some old illumination. Yet withal rather jewel-like: like a sudden rose-cut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture. The air is cold, blowing bleak and bitter, the sky is all curd. And that is Cagliari. It has that curious look, as if it could be seen, but not entered. It is like some vision, some memory, something that has passed away. Impossible that one can actually walk in that city: set foot there and eat and laugh there. Ah, no! Yet the ship drifts nearer, nearer, and we are looking for the actual harbour.
The city of Cagliari is situated in the south of Sardinia, overlooking the centre of the eponymous gulf, also called Golfo degli Angeli (""Bay of Angels"") after an ancient legend. The city is spread over and around the hill of the historic district of Castello and nine other limestone hills of the middle-to-late Miocene, unique heights of a little more than 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level on the long plains of Campidano. The plain is actually a Graben formed during the Alpine orogeny of the Cenozoic, which separated Sardinia from the European continent, roughly where the Gulf of Lion is now. The Graben filled in the course of tectonic movements associated with the breakup of the ancient island Paleozoic skeleton.

The repeated intrusion of the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari. Castello is where the fortified town arose in the Middle Age near the harbour of the port, other hills are those of Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, also known as the Sella del Diavolo (""Saddle of the Devil"") for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, the site of the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where the basilica stands, and the San Michele hill, with the eponymous castle on top. The modern city occupies the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and southeast, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, and the remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape with many landmarks and panoramas of the bay, the plain, and the mountains that surround it on the east (The Seven Brothers and Serpeddì) and west (the mountains of Capoterra). On the cold, clear days of winter, the snowy peaks of Gennargentu can be seen from the highest points of the city.

The city has four historic neighbourhoods: Castello, Marina, Stampace and Villanova and several modern districts (such as San Benedetto, Monte Urpinu and Genneruxi at the east, Sant'Avendrace at the west, Is Mirrionis/San Michele at north and Bonaria, La Palma and Poetto at the south), grown when part of the ancient walls had been demolished in the middle of the 19th century.


=== Pirri ===
The comune of Cagliari has one circoscrizione, the town of Pirri (about 30.000 inhabitants), former village of the Campidano absorbed in the fast growth after the Second World War.


=== Parks and recreation ===

Cagliari is one of the ""greenest"" Italian cities. Every inhabitant of Cagliari has access to 87.5 square metres (942 sq ft) of public gardens and parks.
Its mild climate allows the growth of numerous subtropical plants, such as Jacaranda mimosifolia, Ficus macrophylla, with some huge specimens in Via Roma and in the University Botanic Gardens, Erythrina afra with its stunning red flowers, Ficus retusa, which provides shade for several of the city's streets, Araucaria heterophylla, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), the Canary Islands palm (Phoenix canariensis) and the Mexican Fan Palm (Washingtonia robusta).
Major city parks include: 

Monte Urpinu Park, the most wooded, is a low hill covered by a pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and evergreen oak (Quercus ilex L.) forest with a dense Mediterranean maquis of mastic (Pistacia lentiscus L.), juniper (Juniperus phoenicea L.), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera L.), wild olive (Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea, var. sylvestris) and tree spurge (Euphorbia dendroides L.). It extends for about 25 hectares (62 acres).
Park of San Michele hill (about 25 hectares), with its medieval castle on the top;
Terramaini Park, about 13 hectares (32 acres), with a little pond which is home to flamingos and other wading birds;
Monte Claro Provincial Park, about 22 hectares (54 acres), which hosts the provincial library in an old mansion on the top of the hill;
Ex-vetreria Pirri Park, about 2.5 hectares (6.2 acres);
Public gardens, the oldest public esplanade of the city, planted in the 19th century, with a wonderful promenade of Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don.
The Molentargius - Saline Regional Park is located near the city. Some mountain parks, such as Monte Arcosu or Maidopis, with large forests and wildlife (Sardinian deer, wild boars, etc.) are also nearby.
The city is the starting and ending point of the Path of 100 Towers, which consist of a trekking route named after the 105 towers located along the whole Sardinian coast.


==== Beaches ====

The main beach of Cagliari is the Poetto. It stretches for about 8 kilometres (5 mi), from Sella del Diavolo (""Devil's Saddle"") up to the coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius (""Molentargius's Salt Mine"").
Another smaller beach is that of Calamosca near the Sant'Elia district. On the coast between Calamosca and Poetto beaches, among the cliffs of the Sella del Diavolo, lies Cala Fighera, a small bay.
Cagliari is close to other seaside locations such as Santa Margherita di Pula, Chia, Geremeas, Solanas, Villasimius and Costa Rei.


=== Climate ===
Cagliari has a  cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk), with hot, dry summers and mild winters like other historical regions along the coast. Its precipitation values also bring it closer to semi-arid conditions. The summer extreme values can be slightly over 40 °C (104 °F), sometimes with very high humidity, while in winter, under special and rare conditions, the temperature drops slightly below zero. Heavy snowfalls occur on average every thirty years.
The average temperature of the coldest month, January, is about 10 °C (50 °F), and of the warmest month, August, about 25 °C (77 °F). But heat waves can occur, due to African anticyclone, starting in June. From mid-June to mid-September, rain is a rare event, limited to brief afternoon storms. The rainy season starts in September, and the first cold days come in December.
Winds are frequent, especially the mistral and sirocco; in summer a marine sirocco breeze (called s'imbattu in Sardinian language) lowers the temperature and brings some relief from the heat.


== Demographics ==

According to ISTAT, in 2014 there were 154,356 people residing in Cagliari (+3.0% compared with 2011), of whom 71,522 were male and 82,834 female for a sex ratio of 0.86. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totaled 12.92% of the population, compared to pensioners at 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population over 65 years of age to that under the age of 18, is 53.39%. The elderly population, defined as being over 65 years of age, has increased by 21.95% over the last 10 years. The current birth rate in Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of people of any age per household is 2.11 and the percentage of households composed of a single person is 42.53%. The population of Cagliari is structured like that of other first world countries, especially as to the prevalence of an elderly population. The trend of these rates in the Cagliari metropolitan area is proportionally reversed in the suburbs, where most younger families move.
As of 2024, 6.1% (9,034 people) of the population was foreign, of which the largest group were Filipinos (18.65%), followed by Ukrainians (11.01%), Chinese (7.72%), Senegalese (7.29%) and Bangladeshis (7.16%).
In 1928, during the fascist regime, the neighbouring municipalities of Pirri, Monserrato, Selargius, Quartucciu and Elmas, were merged with that of Cagliari. Mussolini's regime wanted to streamline the local administration by eliminating many small towns and at the same time show that Italy was a major power with many large cities. After the war these small municipalities gradually regained their autonomy, except for the former town of Pirri.
The first table shows the inhabitants of the town in its present borders, the second one the commune population including the merged municipalities.


=== Metropolitan City ===

The Metropolitan City of Cagliari has been established in 2016 by a Sardinia Regional Law and totals about 420,000 inhabitants according to ISTAT. It is composed of 17 municipalities along the coast of the gulf and up to 20 kilometres (12 mi) of the inner Campidano plain.
It covers an area on the plain of Campidano between large basins (Santa Gilla lagoon and salt mills of about 30 km2 or 3200 acres), ponds (Molentargius), 16,22 km2 (40,10 acres) and the depopulated mountains up to 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) above sea level. The mountains are largely covered by forests mostly managed by the Ente Foreste of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. To the west these amount to 256 square kilometres (99 sq mi) on the Capoterra and Pula mountains. Monte Arcosu WWF Natural Reserve has another 36 square kilometres (14 sq mi), and to the east on Mount Serpeddì and Sette Fratelli there are a total of 132 square kilometres (51 sq mi) of forest.
The Metropolitan City is defined by municipalities where the population increased between the last two censuses, in a region where the population is otherwise generally decreasing. These municipalities welcome immigrants to the urban area whose main nucleus, the city of Cagliari, has a high number of elderly people.
In the last century, the population of the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 354% and in the last 50 years by 158% (1911: 128,444; 1961: 288,683; 2011: 454,819). For the whole of Sardinia this increase was respectively 88% and 15% (1911: 868,181; 1961: 1,419,362; 2011: 1,639,362). The urbanisation towards the area of Cagliari was, in percentage terms, impressive, making the capital of the island a metropolis surrounded by rural areas increasingly depopulated. This urbanisation is also reflected in the concentration in Cagliari of most of the economic activities and wealth.


== Economy ==

According to 2014 data from the Italian Ministry of Economic Affairs, the inhabitants of Cagliari benefited a per capita income of 23,220 euros (being the fifth Regional Capital), that is the 122% of the national average, while all of Sardinia benefited only 16,640 euros, being the 13th Region and 86% of the national average. The metropolitan area benefited an average income of 19,185 euros, 103% of the national average. With the 26% of the island population the Cagliari Metropolitan City produces the 31% of its GDP.
As the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Cagliari is the administrative hub and headquarters of the region as well as of the provincial and regional offices of the Italian central administration. Cagliari is also the main trade and industrial centre of the island, with numerous commercial sites and factories within its metropolitan boundaries.
Cagliari is the fourth port of Italy for movement of goods in tons (35,922,468), and the 18th for passengers (705,715), of whom 394,697 cruise passengers (8th in Italy).
The first department store, (La Rinascente) opened in 1931 in the centre of the city, and it is still open today. Nowadays there are many commercial centres in the metropolitan area (Le Vele, Santa Gilla, La Corte del Sole, Marconi) hosting many European chain stores such as Auchan, Metro AG, Lidl, MediaWorld, Euronics, Jysk, IKEA, Carrefour and Bata Shoes. Cagliari is also home to an Amazon customer service center.
Cagliari is the main operational headquarters of the Banco di Sardegna, which belongs to the BPER Group and is listed on Borsa Italiana, of the Banca di Cagliari. Banca di Credito Sardo was based in Cagliari until it was absorbed by the parent company Intesa Sanpaolo.
The Macchiareddu-Grogastru area between Cagliari and Capoterra is one of the most important industrial areas of Sardinia, in conjunction with a large international container terminal port at Giorgino. Beside having one of the biggest container terminals on the Mediterranean Sea, Cagliari also has one of the largest fish markets in Italy offering for sale a vast array of fish to both the public and traders. The communications provider Tiscali also has its headquarters in Cagliari.
Multinational corporations like Coca-Cola, Heineken, Unilever, Bridgestone and Eni Group have factories in town. One of the six oil refinery supersites in Europe, Saras, is located within the metropolitan area at Sarroch.

Tourism is one of the major industries of the city, although historical venues such as its monumental Middle Ages and Early modern period defence system, its Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine ruins are less highlighted compared to the recreational beaches and coastline. Cruise ships touring the Mediterranean often stop for passengers at Cagliari, and the city is a traffic hub to the nearby beaches of Villasimius, Chia, Pula and Costa Rei, as well as to the urban beach of Poettu. Pula is home to the archaeological site of the Punic and Roman city of Nora. Especially in summer many clubs and pubs are goals for young locals and tourists. Pubs and night-clubs are concentrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a narrow street in Stampace district, in the Marina district, near the port and in the Castello district, The clubs are mostly to be found on the Poetto Beach (in summer) or in Viale Marconi (in winter). In Cagliari there are 180 B&B and 22 hotels that totals 3,300 beds. There are many others hotels in seaside resort of his gulf.


== Main sights ==
Considerable remains of the ancient city of Karalis are still visible, including those of the Tuvixeddu necropolis (the largest Punic necropolis still in existence), the Roman amphitheatre, traditionally called Is centu scalas (""One hundred steps""), and of an aqueduct used to provide generally scarce water. Still visible are also some ancient cisterns of vast extent, the ruins of a small circular temple, and numerous sepulchres on a hill outside the modern town that appear to have formed the necropolis of the ancient city.

The Palaeo-Christian Basilica of San Saturnino, dedicated to a martyr killed under Diocletian's reign, Saturninus of Cagliari, patron saint of the city, was built in the 5th century. Of the original building the dome and the central part remain, to which two arms (one with a nave and two aisles) were added later. A Palaeo-Christian crypt is also under the church of San Lucifero (1660), dedicated to Saint Lucifer, a bishop of the city. The church has a Baroque façade with ancient columns and sculpted parts, some of which came from the nearby necropolis.

The old medieval town (called Castello in Italian, Casteddu de susu in Sardinian, ""the upper castle"") lies on top of a hill with a view of the Gulf of Cagliari (also known as Angels' Gulf). Most of its city walls are intact and include two early 14th-century white limestone towers, the Torre di San Pancrazio and the Torre dell'Elefante, typical examples of Pisan military architecture. The local white limestone was also used to build the walls of the city and many other buildings, besides the towers. The exact period of construction of a fortress on this hill is unknown at present, due to the superposition of layers of buildings along the history. Some scholars have suggested a first urbanization of the quarter in the Punic era on the basis of similarity of the planimetry with the contemporary Carthaginian fortress of Monte Sirai. Recently, archaeological excavations have identified Punic and Roman buildings under the ramparts of the fortress. Already the Roman poet Varro called the city ""Vicus munitus"", a fortified city, and sixteenth-century authors describe a Roman acropolis perhaps still visible in their day.
D. H. Lawrence, in his memoir of a voyage to Sardinia, Sea and Sardinia, that he undertook in January 1921, described the effect of warm Mediterranean sunlight on the white limestone city and compared Cagliari to a ""white Jerusalem"".

The cathedral was restored in the 1930s, returning the former Baroque façade into a Medieval Pisan-style façade more akin to the original appearance of the church in the 13th century. The bell tower is original. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a pulpit (1159–1162) sculpted for the Cathedral of Pisa but later donated to Cagliari. The crypt houses the remains of martyrs found in the Basilica of San Saturno (see below). Near the cathedral is the palace of the provincial government. Before 1900 it was the island's governor's palace.

The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Bonaria (from which the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, gets its name) was built by the Catalans in 1324–1329 when they were besieging the Pisans in Castello. It has a small Gothic portal in the façade and the interior houses a wooden statue of the Madonna, which, after having been thrown off a Spanish ship, landed at the foot of Bonaria hill. Bonaria hill is also the location of the Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria.
The Chiesa della Purissima is a Catalan Gothic church built in the 16th century in the Castello distinct.
The other early districts of the town (Marina, Stampace and Villanova) retain much of their original character. In Stampace the Torre dello Sperone, another tower built by the Pisans in the late 13th century, is located, as well as two important monumental churches: the Collegiata di Sant'Anna and the Chiesa di San Michele, both built in the 18th century in a baroque style. Many more churches, both old and modern, can be found throughout the city.
The Promenade Deck and the Terrazza Umberto I were designed in 1896 by the engineers Joseph Costa and Fulgenzio Setti. The entire building was built of white and yellow limestone in a classical style with Corinthian columns. It was opened in 1901. A staircase with two flights provides access from Constitution Square. It is interrupted by a covered walkway and ends beneath the Arc de Triomphe, in the Terrazza Umberto I. In 1943, during World War II, the staircase and the Arch of Triumph were severely damaged by aerial bombardment, but after the conflict they were faithfully reconstructed.
From the Terrazza Umberto I the Bastion of Santa Caterina can be accessed via a short flight of steps. Here there was once an old Dominican convent, destroyed by fire in 1800. According to tradition, the conspiracy to kill the Viceroy Camarassa in 1666 was set up in the surroundings of the monastery.

The Promenade Deck was inaugurated in 1902. At first it was used as a banqueting hall, then during the First World War as an infirmary. In the 1930s, during the period of sanctions, it was an exhibition of autarky  During World War II it served as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by bombs. In 1948 it hosted the first Trade Fair of Sardinia. After many years of decay, the Promenade was restored and re-evaluated as a cultural space reserved especially for art exhibitions. 
The modern districts built in the late 19th and early 20th century contain examples of Art Deco architecture, as well as controversial examples of Fascist neoclassicism architecture, such as the Court of Justice (Palazzo di Giustizia) in Republic Square. The Court of Justice is near the biggest city park, Monte Urpinu, with its pine trees, artificial lakes, and a vast area with a hill. The Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari, the city's botanical garden, is also of interest.


== Culture ==

The city has numerous libraries and is also home to the State Archive, containing thousands of handwritten documents from the foundation of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1325 AD) to the present. In addition to numerous local and university department libraries, the most important libraries are the old University Library, with thousands of ancient books, the Provincial Library, the Regional Library, and the Mediateca of the Mediterranean, which contains the municipal archive and library collection.
In the first century B.C. a famous singer and musician from Cagliari, Tigellius, lived in Rome and was satirized by Cicero and Horace. The history of Sardinian literature begins in Cagliari in the first century A.D. In the funerary monument of Atilia Pomptilla, carved into the rock of the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, poems are engraved in Greek and Latin dedicated to his dead wife. Some of them, particularly those in the Greek language, have literary merit.
The first Sardinian literary author known was Bishop Lucifer of Cagliari, who wrote severe pamphlets against the Arian heresy in the fourth century A.D. Only in the eleventh century A.D. did the first texts of an administrative nature appear in the modern Sardinian language, together with hagiographies of local martyrs written in Latin.
Life in Cagliari has been depicted by many writers, starting with the late Roman poet Claudian. In the late 16th century, the local humanist Roderigo Hunno Baeza dedicated to his town a didactic Latin poem, Caralis Panegyricus. At the beginning of the 17th century Juan Francisco Carmona wrote a hymn to Cagliari in Spanish; Jacinto Arnal De Bolea published in 1636, in Spanish, the first novel set in Cagliari, entitled El Forastero. David Herbert Lawrence wrote about the city in his Sea and Sardinia.
Modern writers connected to Cagliari include Giuseppe Dessì, Giulio Angioni, Giorgio Todde, Sergio Atzeni (who set many of his novels and short stories, such as Bakunin's Son, in ancient and modern Cagliari), Flavio Soriga.

Cagliari was the birthplace or residence of the composer Ennio Porrino, of the film, theatre and TV director Nanni Loy, and of the actors Gianni Agus, Amedeo Nazzari and Pier Angeli (born Anna Maria Pierangeli).
Excluding the Roman era amphitheater, the first theater was inaugurated in Cagliari in 1767: the Teatro Zapata, later becoming the Civic Theatre. Devastated by bombing in 1943, it was recently restored, but the roof was not rebuilt, and today it serves as an open-air theatre. The Politeama Regina Margherita, inaugurated in 1859, was destroyed by fire in 1942 and never rebuilt.
Although opera had, and in part still has, a solid tradition the city, it was left without a true theater until 1993 when a new opera house, the Teatro Lirico, was inaugurated. Inside there is a music compound with a music conservatory with its own auditorium, and a music park. Cagliari is and was home to opera singers such as the tenors Giovanni Matteo Mario (Giovanni Matteo De Candia, 1810–1883) and Piero Schiavazzi (1875–1949), the baritone Angelo Romero (born 1940), the contralto Bernadette Manca di Nissa, born 1954 and the soprano Giusy Devinu (1960–2007).
The Italian pop singer Marco Carta was also born in Cagliari, in 1985.
The old Teatro Massimo was only recently renovated and is now the seat of the Teatro Stabile of Sardinia. The Municipal Auditorium, in the former 17th-century church of Santa Teresa, is the seat of the Scuola di Arte Drammatica (School of Dramatic Art) di Cagliari, while the Teatro delle Saline (""Saltworks Theatre""), is home of Akroama, Teatro Stabile di Innovazione (""Permanent Theater of Innovation"").
Finally, some comic and satirical theater companies are active in the city, the most well known being the ""Compagnia Teatrale Lapola"", which offers an urban version of the traditional campidanese comic theater.
Founded by Bepi Vigna, Antonio Serra and Michele Medda, a comic book school, the Centro Internazionale del Fumetto (""Comic Strip International Centre"") has been active for several decades. Its founders invented and designed the comic characters Nathan Never and Legs Weaver.


=== Museums and galleries ===

=== Feast of Sant'Efis ===
 
The Feast of St. Ephysius (Sant'Efisio in Italian, Sant'Efis in Sardinian) is the most important religious event of Cagliari, taking place every year on 1 May. During this festival, thousands of people from folk groups all over Sardinia wear their traditional costumes. The saint is escorted by the traditional ancient Milicia, the deputy mayor (Alter Nos), numerous confraternities, and a convoy of chariots pulled by oxen in a procession to Nora (near modern Pula), 35 km (22 mi) from Cagliari, where, according to tradition, he was beheaded. In addition to being one of the oldest, it is also the longest Italian religious procession, with about 70 km (43 mi) of walks over four days, and the largest in the Mediterranean area.
A plague was spreading throughout Sardinia, starting in 1652, and the epidemic infected Cagliari in particular, killing some ten thousand inhabitants. According to legend, in 1656 St. Ephysius appeared to the Spanish Viceroy, Francisco Fernández de Castro Andrade, Count of Lemos to request a procession on 1 May, in order to free the city from the plague. The Municipality of Cagliari swore that, if the plague disappeared, a procession would be held every day in the saint's honor, starting from the Stampace district and ending at Nora where the saint was martyred. In September the plague ended, and the procession and festival was therefore regularly held starting the following year on 1 May. The procession was held even during the last war; a statue of the saint was placed on a lorry and, through city ruins of the devastated by the bombs, arrived safely in Nora.


=== Other events ===
Other feasts and events in Cagliari include:

The Carnival
Holy Week and Easter celebrations
Sea processions of St. Francis of Paola, held in May, and Nostra Signora di Bonaria, in July
Cagliari Fair, in early May
Audi MedCup regatta


=== Languages ===

The native language of Cagliari, declared official along with Italian, is Sardinian (sardu), a Romance language, specifically the Campidanese dialect (campidanesu) in its local variant (casteddaju).
The variant of Cagliari in its high register has traditionally represented the linguistic model of reference for the entire southern area of the island, and the high social variant used by the middle class in the whole Campidanese domain, as well as the literary model of reference for writers and poets. This language is less spoken by the younger generations in the city, who use Italian instead as that language is compulsory in education and the mass media. Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, both formal and informal, relegating Sardinian to a mostly marginal role in everyday life. Young people often have only passive competence in the language, gathered from elderly relatives who still speak it, as their parents often speak only Italian, or they may use a slang (italianu porceddinu) that mixes both Sardinian and Italian.
Since Cagliari was the metropolis of the ancient Roman province, it absorbed innovations coming from Rome, Carthage, and Constantinople, and its language probably reflected late Latin urban dialects of the 5th-century core cities of the empire.


=== Gastronomy ===
Cagliari has some unique gastronomic traditions: unlike the rest of the island its cuisine is mostly based on the wide variety of locally available seafood. Although it is possible to trace influences from Catalan, Sicilian and Genoese cuisine, Cagliaritan food has a distinctive and unique character.
Excellent wines are also part of Cagliaritanians' dinners, like the Cannonau, Nuragus, Nasco, Monica, Moscau, Girò and Malvasia, produced in the nearby vineyards of the Campidano plain.


== Media ==
The main newspaper of Sardinia is L'Unione Sarda, it was founded in Cagliari in 1889. It was one of the first European newspapers to have its own website in 1994. It has a circulation of about 85,000 copies.
The main regional headquarters of RAI, the Italian state-owned radio and television network, is in Cagliari. There are also two regional television and radio companies as well as numerous information sites on the internet.


== Sports ==

Cagliari is home to the football team Cagliari Calcio, winner of the Italian league championship in 1970, when the team was led by Gigi Riva. Founded in 1920, the club played at the Stadio Sant'Elia in the city from 1970 until it was closed in the summer of 2017, causing the club to temporarily relocate to the provisional Sardegna Arena (now Unipol Domus). Sant'Elia was the venue for three 1990 FIFA World Cup matches.
Cagliari is an ideal location for water sports such as surfing, kitesurfing, windsurfing and sailing due to strong and reliable favourable winds. Field hockey is also popular, with two teams in the Italian top division, G.S. Amsicora and C.U.S. Cagliari, the first of which won the league title more often than any other Italian team in the men's championship (20) and is also the protagonist in the women's division.
Sport venues in Cagliari include:

Unipol Domus
Tennis Club Cagliari
Rockfeller sports hall
Rockfeller skating rink

== Government ==

Cagliari is the hub of the administration offices of the Sardinia Autonomous Region and of Cagliari Province. It is also the home of several local offices of the Italian central administration.
It is the seat of the Superintendency of Cultural and Environmental Heritage, of the Sardinia Archival Superintendency and of the Archeological Superintendency of the Cultural Heritage Ministry, of the Sardinia and Provincial seat of the Employment and Social Policies Ministry, of the regional offices of the Finance and Economy Ministry, and of some branch offices of the Health Ministry.
Cagliari is home to all criminal, civil, administrative and accounting courts for Sardinia of the Ministry of Justice up to the High Court of Assizes of Appeal. It was home to a prison, Buon Cammino, built in the late 19th century, famous because no one has ever managed to escape. A new modern prison has been built in the nearby town of Uta.
Traditionally, votes in Cagliari are oriented towards the center-right wing. Since World War II, all the mayors belonged to the Christian Democracy party with the exception of Salvatore Ferrara, from the Socialist Party, allied with the former. After the collapse of the traditional parties in the 1990s, the mayors belonged to the party or the coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi. The current economic and political crisis that affects Italy has prompted the electorate toward a large abstention and to elect a young mayor, Massimo Zedda, who belongs to a centre-left alliance. In the last municipal elections in June 2016, Massimo Zedda was confirmed in the first round with 50.86% of the votes.


== Education ==

Cagliari is home to the University of Cagliari, the largest public university in Sardinia, founded in 1626. It currently includes six faculties: Engineering and Architecture, Medicine and Surgery, Economics, Juridical and Political Sciences, Basic Sciences, Biology and Pharmacy, Humanistic Studies.
It is attended by about 35,000 students. All science faculties of the university, as well as the university hospital, have been transferred to a new ""University Citadel"", located in Monserrato. Cagliari's downtown houses the engineering and the humanities divisions and, in the Castle, the seat of the Rector, in an 18th-century palace with a library of thousands of ancient books.
Cagliari is also the seat of the Pontifical Faculty of Theology of Sardinia and of the European Institute of Design.


== Health care ==

Life expectancy in Cagliari is high: 79.5 years for men and 85.4 for women (provincial level).
There has been a public hospital in Cagliari since the 17th century. The first modern structure was built in the middle of the 19th century, designed by the architect Gaetano Cima. This hospital is still operating, although all its departments will eventually be transferred to the new University Hospital in Monserrato.
Among the other public hospitals, the Giuseppe Brotzu (San Michele) Hospital was recognized in 1993 as a High Specialization Nationally Relevant Hospital, particularly for liver, heart, pancreas and bone marrow transplants.
Other public hospitals in the city include: the Santissima Trinità or commonly Is Mirrionis; the Binaghi, specialised in pulmonology; Marino specialised in traumatology, hyperbaric medicine and spinal cord injuries; Businco specialised in oncology; and Microcitemico, specialised in thalassemia, Genetic diseases and rare diseases. There are in addition many private hospitals.
Despite its dry climate, thanks to the regional system of dams, every inhabitant of Cagliari may have 363 litres (96 US gal) per day of safe drinking water.
Waste sorting is still at a low level: only 33.4 percent of waste is separated.

Elysius,genus,wikipedia.org,"Elysius is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
Elysius is an artificially created being constructed by the Titanian super computer ISAAC, and possesses some of the superhuman attributes of an Eternal from Titan.  She became the lover of Mar-Vell, and after his death used his genetic material to impregnate herself with Genis-Vell and Phyla-Vell.


== Publication history ==
Elysius debuted in Captain Marvel #59 (Nov. 1978), and was created by writer Doug Moench and artist Pat Broderick.


== Fictional character biography ==
Elysius was created by ISAAC, the sentient computer system of Titan, after it was corrupted by Thanos. She serves as ISAAC's lieutenant and aided it in conquering Titan.
She later aided Captain Mar-Vell and Drax the Destroyer against ISAAC, Stellarax, Lord Gaea, and Chaos. She then began her romance with Mar-Vell. She returned to Earth with Mar-Vell and Rick Jones.
Elysius later accompanied Mar-Vell to Denver to visit Rick Jones. She accompanied Betty Ross, Rick, and Fred Sloan to Gamma Base in search of Mar-Vell and the Hulk. She departed Gamma Base with Mar-Vell.
Some time later, Elysius attended the death-watch of Captain Mar-Vell.


== Powers and abilities ==
Elysius is an artificially created being patterned on and possessing some of the attributes of the Titanians, a lesser sub-branch of the long-lived offshoot of humanity called the Eternals. She has enhanced stamina, and her strength, speed, and durability are higher than that of a human, although she does not possess the ability to fly or levitate.  She has limited telepathic abilities of an unrevealed nature. She keeps griffin-like creatures which obey her telepathic commands.
She uses an alien hand-weapon capable of disrupting force fields or of firing energy of an unspecified nature as bursts of concussive force. ISAAC crafted her personal sky-ship, which resembles an ancient Earth galleon but possesses the capacity of flight.

Alucita,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Alucita,genus,wikipedia.org,"Alucita is the largest genus of many-plumed moths (family Alucitidae); it is also the type genus of its family and the disputed superfamily Alucitoidea. This genus occurs almost worldwide and contains about 180 species as of 2011; new species are still being described and discovered regularly. Formerly, many similar moths of superfamilies Alucitoidea, Copromorphoidea and Pterophoroidea were also placed in Alucita.
The genus Alucita was established by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as a subgenus of Phalaena, Linné's ""wastebin genus"" for moths. Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775 seems to have been the first author to consider Alucita a genus in its own right, and it remains so until today. However, some subsequent authors believed Linnaeus' name to be invalid, and established alternative names for this genus, but, while the oldest of these, Pierre André Latreille's Orneodes, was used instead of Alucita for a long time, all these subsequent names are today recognized as junior synonyms.

Amastus,genus,wikipedia.org,"Amastus is a genus of moths in the family Erebidae. The genus was erected by Francis Walker in 1855.


== Taxonomy ==
The delimitation of Amastus versus Hemihyalea has long been problematic. It was recently determined that the type species of Hemihyalea (the old Phaegoptera cornea) is so closely related to that of Amastus
(P. collaris) as to warrant inclusion in the present genus. That determination led to the reestablishment of the genus Pseudohemihyalea for the more distantly related group of species around ""Hemihyalea"" schausi. There is no consensus yet on whether to include the remaining Hemihyalea species in Amastus.


== Selected species ==
Species of Amastus include:

Amastis aconia (Herrich-Schäffer 1853)
Amastus bicolor (Maassen, 1890)
Amastus cellularis Rothschild, 1922
Amastus collaris (Herrich-Schäffer, [1853])

== Taxonomy ==
The type species, Hemihyalea cornea, has been proposed for inclusion in Amastus, and other species that were previously classified in Hemihyalea have consequently been moved to the re-established genus Pseudohemihyalea. It is unclear at present whether Hemihyalea is a valid genus at all, and if so, which species other than H. cornea it would contain.


== Distribution ==
Hemihyalea cornea is found in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.

Areva,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Areva,genus,wikipedia.org,"Areva S.A. was a French multinational group specializing in nuclear power, active between 2001 and 2018. It was headquartered in Courbevoie, France. Before its 2016 corporate restructuring, Areva was majority-owned by the French state through the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (54.37%), Banque publique d'investissement (3.32%), and Agence des participations de l'État (28.83%). Électricité de France, in which the French government has a majority ownership stake, owned 2.24%; the Kuwait Investment Authority owned 4.82% as the second largest shareholder after the French state.
As a part of the restructuring program following its insolvency, Areva sold or discontinued its renewable energy businesses and sold its reactors subsidiary Areva NP (which has reverted to its original name, Framatome) to EDF. Its nuclear propulsion and research reactors subsidiary Areva TA (now TechnicAtome) was sold to the Agence des participations de l'État and its nuclear cycle business was reorganized into a separate company New Areva (becoming Orano). A new holding, Areva S.A., was also created to act as a hive-off vehicle for Areva's ongoing “at-risk” activities, including the completion and delivery of the Olkiluoto 3 in Finland, execution of Areva's remaining renewable energy projects, and finalization of the sale of Areva NP to EDF.
In 2017, the sale of Areva TA was finalized and in January 2018, so was that of Areva NP, while New Areva was rebranded Orano; these developments marked the end of the Areva group.


== History ==


=== Creation ===

Areva was created on 3 April 2001 by the merger of Framatome (later: Areva NP, now: Framatome), Cogema (later: Areva NC, now: Orano Cycle) and Technicatome (later: Areva TA, now: Technicatome). It was based on the structure of its precursor, CEA-Industrie. Anne Lauvergeon became its first CEO. 
Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the former Prime Minister of France, announced the privatization of Areva in 2003, but it was postponed several times, the French government opting finally for the privatization of GDF and EDF. At the end of October 2005, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin announced that he had suspended the privatization process.
In 2003, Areva secured a contract for the Olkiluoto 3 project, which foresaw construction of the third generation EPR-type pressurised water reactor.  In 2004 a contracted fixed price was established as €3.2 billion. Construction started in 2005.
In 2004, Areva acquired Alstom's transmission and distribution activities, which became Areva T&D. It was sold back to Alstom and Schneider Electric in June 2010.
On 15 September 2005, Areva and Constellation Energy of Baltimore announced a joint venture called UniStar Nuclear to market the commercial EPR in the United States. The joint venture later became UniStar Nuclear Energy in 2007. In 2010, EDF acquired 100% of UniStar Nuclear Energy. However these plans failed to come to fruition, and in February 2015 Areva suspended the EPR Design Certification Application Review process at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
In 2006, Areva created its renewable energies business group. Creusot Forge and Creusot Mécanique merged into the Areva group, even though there were quality concerns over Creusot Forge's work. In 2007, Areva purchased 51% of offshore wind turbine manufacturer Multibrid. Multibrid has been a start-up and German offshore wind pioneer, producing wind turbines in Bremerhaven. The innovative M5000 wind turbine has a compact medium speed drive train and carbon rotor blades. The patented air treatment to prevent corrosion was unique. The turbine was designed by aerodyn Energiesysteme GmbH. 
In 2015 the renewable unit of Areva changed into ADWEN GmbH.
In June 2010, Areva purchased the remaining 49% and formed Areva Wind. In February 2010, Areva bought Ausra, and renamed it Areva Solar.
In 2007, Areva purchased UraMin, which later became Areva Resources Southern Africa (now part of Orano).
In 2007, Areva started construction of the Flamanville 3 EPR reactor. In addition, in November 2007 Areva agreed to an €8 billion deal with the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group to supply them with two EPRs for Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. Under the terms of the agreement, Areva also had to help operate the plant, including the reprocessing of spent fuel. Also in 2007, Areva and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries created a joint venture named Atmea to develop a 1,100 MWe Atmea-1 pressurised water reactor (Generation III reactor). In 2009, Siemens sold its remaining shares of Areva NP and Arvea NP became wholly owned by Areva. At the same year, Areva NP acquired 30% stake in the Mitsubishi Nuclear Fuel company.
On 6 May 2008, Areva announced that it would seek all necessary approvals to build an enrichment facility in Bonneville County, Idaho. The project was later cancelled. Also in 2008, Areva was awarded an operations contract to clean up the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site as part of the Nuclear Management Partners consortium, made up of URS, Amec and Areva.
In June 2008, Areva reached an agreement with Kazatomprom to create a joint-venture Katco.
On 4 February 2009, Areva signed a memorandum to supply two to six nuclear reactors to the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited for the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in the Indian state of Maharashtra.
In March 2010, Areva indicated work was being done on a new type of burner reactor type capable of breaking down actinides created as a product of nuclear fission.
In 2011, Areva was listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris.


=== Post-Fukushima problems ===
In December 2011, Areva suspended building work at several sites in France, Africa and the United States, one day after forecasting a €1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) loss.
Areva halted ""capacity extensions"" at its La Hague Reprocessing Plant, in northern France, at its Melox factory in the southwest, and at two sites attached to its Tricastin power plant in the south. Work has also stopped on extensions to uranium mines in Bakouma in the Central African Republic, Trekkopje in Namibia, and Ryst Kuil in South Africa, and caused a potential delay in construction until a capital solution is secured for the Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility in the United States. Areva wrote off most of the $2.5 billion purchase cost of Canadian uranium mining company Uramin, purchased in 2007, after concluding that its uranium ore deposits were of negligible value.
In September 2014 Standard & Poor's stated it might downgrade Areva's credit rating following weak first-half results, leading to Areva indicating it would cut capital spending and dispose of some assets. In March 2015 Standard & Poor's further downgraded Areva's credit rating to BB− after Areva posted a €4.8 billion loss for 2014.
In 2012, Areva acquired the hydrogen technology developer Compagnie européenne des technologies de l'hydrogène (CETH) and renamed it Areva H2Gen. In the same year, it inaugurated a hydrogen storage system called the MYRTE platform near Ajaccio, Corsica (MYRTE is the French acronym for Mission Hydrogène Renouvelable pour l’intégration au réseau électrique). The system aims to establish the feasibility of a storage solution for solar energy using hydrogen technologies, which would serve as a back-up system to stabilize Corsica's power grid. In 2014, Areva's energy storage and management system, the Greenergy Box, was added to the existing installation, in operation since early 2013. In January 2014, Areva and Spain's wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica created on the basis of Areva Wind a joint venture Adwen. In August 2014, Areva exited the solar industry.
In October 2013, Areva won a $2.7 billion contract to supply two EPR nuclear reactors with nuclear steam supply and control systems at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, England. It will also provide uranium extraction and enrichment for the fuel fabrication stage.
In December 2013, Areva and China General Nuclear Power (CGN) agreed to a partnership in renewable energy, with a focus on offshore wind, biomass, concentrated solar power, and energy storage.
In October 2014, CEO Luc Oursel took a leave of absence for health reasons. He died in December of the same year. On 20 November 2014 Standard & Poor's downgraded Areva long-term debt to BB+ and short-term-debt to A-3.
In May 2014, Areva, through its subsidiary CETH2, and the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency), announced the creation of the AREVA H2-Gen joint venture.
In December 2015 operations at Le Creusot Forge were stopped following a discovery at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. About 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply. In December 2016 international inspectors found evidence of recent doctored paperwork, which had not been detected by Areva's independent quality control checks. In April 2017 Autorité de sûreté nucléaire (ASN) published the requirements for forging to resume at Le Creusot Forge. In August 2017 ASN published a draft decision requiring the examination of Le Creusot Forge manufacturing records of all components during scheduled reactor refuelling outages.


=== Restructuring ===
In June 2016 Areva's restructuring plans were made public, including the sale of the majority of its reactor business to EDF in 2017, excluding the Olkiluoto 3 EPR under construction in Finland which will remain with Areva SA. In December 2017, Areva and EDF signed agreements on the transfer of Areva NP's nuclear reactor operations. As part of the restructuring plan, Areva created a new fuel cycle company, dubbed as New Co or New Areva. The new company combined Areva Mines, Areva NC, Areva Projects, and Areva Business Support companies. It was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of Areva; however, Areva lost control over the company as the French government invested to recapitalize the company. On 23 January 2018 that company changed its name to Orano. In January 2017, Areva sold its stake in the wind turbine manufacturer Adwen. In March 2017, Areva sold its nuclear propulsion and research reactor subsidiary Areva TA to Agence des Participations de l'Etat.


== Current operations ==

As of 2019, Areva S.A. is responsible only for the liabilities related to the Olkiluoto 3 project. The reactor, which is one of the first of the new Generation III reactors, was initially expected to begin producing electricity in 2009, but project completion was delayed eventually until 2023, and it has faced several price increases. Areva and TVO have reached an agreement, according to which Areva would pay €450 million in compensation over the delays and lost income. The agreement would settle all legal actions between the two companies.
Areva also holds of 40% stake in Orano.


== Past operations ==
Areva was a company with a presence in each industrial activity linked to nuclear energy: mining, chemistry, enrichment, fuel assembly, reprocessing, engineering, nuclear propulsion and reactors, treatment, recycling, stabilization and dismantling. Areva also offered technological solutions for renewable energy. Areva's activities were divided into five business groups.


=== Nuclear operations ===
The mining business group managed the exploration of uranium ore, its extraction, and processing, as well as the restoration of sites after mine closure. It had staff on five continents and operated uranium production sites in Canada, Kazakhstan, and Niger. As of the end of 2013, the Mining Business Group employed 4,463 people. Uranium production accounted for 19% of Areva's consolidated revenue in 2013. It is now part of Orano.
The front end business group provided access to fuel for Areva's customers, and oversees operations to convert uranium into nuclear fuel, including the chemical conversion of ore into uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of uranium, and the design and production of fuel for nuclear reactors. As of the end of 2013, 8,555 people worked for Areva's front end business group. It accounted for 24% of Areva's consolidated revenue in 2013. It is now part of Orano.
The reactors and services business group designed and built pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors, and offers products to service nuclear reactors. It is now part of Framatome. The business group also designed and built naval propulsion and research reactors, which is now Technicatome. The business group had 15,592  employees at the end of 2013 and generated 36% of Areva's revenue in the same year.
The back end business group developed recycling solutions for used fuel for reuse in reactors. It also offered storage and transportation solutions for radioactive material, and site rehabilitation at nuclear facilities. It is now part of Orano. At the end of 2013, it had 11,583 employees and made up for 19% of Areva's revenue. In 2017 the NUHOMS Matrix advanced used nuclear fuel storage overpack, a high-density system for storing multiple spent fuel rods in canisters, was launched.


=== Renewable energy operations ===
Areva created its global renewable energies business group in 2006 as an expansion of its clean energy portfolio with renewable energy. This group represented four business lines: concentrated solar power, offshore wind power, biomass power, and hydrogen power storage and distribution. Areva built biomass power plants worldwide, representing 2.5 GWe of installed capacity. These plants are located in Brazil, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, India and Thailand. Its subsidiary Areva Renewables Brazil built biomass power plants based on bagasse (organic waste from sugar cane). In the United States, Areva formed a partnership with Duke Energy to build and operate 55 MW biomass power plants based on wood waste.
Areva acquired a bio-coal production technology called Thermya, which produces a biofuel issued from biomass torrefaction that can replace coal to generate thermal energy and electricity. Areva also developed AdCub, a modular concept for compact power plants targeting small-scale biomass resources that addresses relatively untapped growth opportunities in Europe. The objective is to combine innovative solutions which optimize customer costs for small-scale power plants (between 3 and 6 MW) and reduce construction time. This new biomass plant concept also aims to improve upstream technologies for multi-fuel acceptance and higher availability.
Areva designed, manufactured and industrialized turnkey energy storage solutions and products to generate electricity with fuel cells and produce hydrogen by electrolysis. Areva supported research in the hydrogen field through partnerships with a number of industrial companies and national research organizations including Agence Nationale de la Recherche, the Horizon Hydrogen Energy (H2E) program, PAN-H (Plan d'Action National sur l'Hydrogène et les piles à combustible) and Pôle Capenergies, an innovation cluster dedicated to the development of renewable forms of energy without greenhouse gas emissions.


=== Other operations ===
Areva was involved in military technology, such as designing the nuclear reactor for the French Barracuda class submarine. One of Areva's subsidiaries, Euriware (founded in 1991) was specialized in consulting and IT services and employs 2,200 people. Areva also owned 1.99% of Safran and 1.4% of Suez Environnement.
CERCA, a subsidiary of Areva that produces fuel for research reactors, was also involved in TRIGA, a research reactor established in 1996 with the US firm General Atomics that is used for training, research, and the production of radioisotopes.
Areva was a former corporate member of the Bruegel think tank.


== Notable incidents ==


=== 2007 fine ===
In January 2007, Areva was fined €53 million by the European Commission for rigging EU electricity markets through a cartel involving 11 companies, including ABB, Alstom, Fuji, Hitachi, AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech Wabag. According to the commission, ""between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.""
Areva is not accused of any cartel involvement other than through the acquisition of an Alstom unit in January 2004. ""This subsidiary was acquired by the Areva group towards the end of the infringement, in January 2004. The parent entities of the Areva group share a joint liability with that subsidiary for the period after its acquisition."" ""A few months before the cartel ended, Alstom sold the unit involved to Areva, which knew nothing of the cartel. It [Areva] and Alstom have joint liability for 53.6 million, which they must decide how to split.""
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes declared that ""The commission has put an end to a cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years"".


=== Libya deal ===
On 13 August 2007, the French newspaper Le Parisien alleged that the Franco-Libyan civil nuclear power agreement signed by President Nicolas Sarkozy did not concern desalinization of sea water, as claimed by the French government, but instead focused in particular on selling the EPR to Libya, a contract potentially worth $3 billion.  Le Parisien cited Philippe Delaune, deputy to the deputy director of international affairs for the CEA atomic agency, which is the main share-holder in Areva. Following allegations that the deal had been related to the release of the Bulgarian nurses, the French Socialist Party, through the spokesperson Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was ""geopolitically irresponsible"". The German government also denounced the agreement.


=== Bakouma assault ===
On 24 June 2012, an armed group assaulted a uranium plant operated by Areva at Bakouma in the southeast of the Central African Republic. A statement by the military described that ""a violent clash on Sunday afternoon pitted"" Central African troops against ""an unidentified group of armed men attempting to launch an assault on the site of mining company Areva"".
According to the report the army successfully repelled the attack, but ""the enemy did some material damage and pulled back while taking a sizeable quantity mainly of food with them."" The Areva group issued no immediate statement regarding the attack. Central African military sources believe that the attack was organized by members of the Chadian rebel group Popular Front for Recovery (FPR) led by 'General' Baba Ladde, which has been active in the region since 2008. The army says it is conducting further operations to neutralize the remaining armed rebels in the region of Bakouma.


=== Attack in Niger ===
In May 2013, the company's uranium mine in Niger was damaged and one civilian was killed in an Al-Qaeda-linked suicide bomb attack. The mine reached full production again in August 2013.


=== Tuareg people ===
In November 2009, Greenpeace released a report indicating that two villages near Areva's mining operations in Niger had dangerously high levels of radiation.
In January 2014, Al Jazeera produced Orphans of the Sahara, three-part series on the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert, in which claims were brought to light that Areva mining and consequent irradiations are causing diseases and deaths among their people.
Al Jazeera also published Areva's response, in which the company said it submits regular reports on its environmental monitoring of water, air and soil to the Nigerien Office of Environmental Assessments and Impact Studies (BEEEI) which indicate that there is no pollution around the sites in question.


== Corporate issues ==


=== Sport sponsorship ===
Areva sponsored several sporting events over the years. In 2009, Areva launched Athlenergy.com, an online resource for runners, and became the sponsor of the French Athletics Federation and the official sponsor of Meeting Areva, a track and field competition held annually at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France. In May 2014, Athlenergy.com became Arevarun. Areva also sponsors several running events, including the Paris Half Marathon and Saintélyon, a night run from Sainte Etienne to Lyon, in France.
In 2008, Areva signed a contract to sponsor the German football club FC Nürnberg until 2012. The contract was completed in 2012.
Areva sponsored the French ""Defi Areva"" team in the 2002 America's Cup race, and the French ""Areva Challenge"" team in the 2007 America's Cup race. In 2002, during its first public appearance, in Lorient, France, the ""Defi Areva"" yacht collided with a dinghy carrying four Greenpeace protesters, and the impact knocked a hole in the side of the 80-foot boat.

Theages,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Theages,genus,wikipedia.org,"Theages (Greek: Θεάγης, also known as ""On Wisdom: Obstetric"" (H ΠΈΡΙ ΣΟΦΙΑΣ᾽ ΜΑΙΕΥΤΙΚΟΣ)) is a dialogue attributed to Plato, featuring Demodocus, Socrates and Theages.  There is debate over its authenticity; W. R. M. Lamb draws this conclusion from his opinion that the work is inferior and un-Socratic, but acknowledges that it was universally regarded as authentic in antiquity.


== Background ==
In the dialogue, Demodocus introduces Socrates with his son Theages, who wishes to study ""how to become wise"". In this dialogue, Socrates makes mention of his daemon, the inner voice he also mentions in the Apology and other works by Plato.
Reference to Theages is made in Plato's Republic (496b): “there are some who are restrained by our friend Theages' bridle; for everything in the life of Theages conspired to divert him from philosophy”.
Theages 125e8–126a4 is quoted by Nietzsche in Will to Power §958: ""In Plato's Theages it is written: 'Each one of us would like to be master over all men, if possible, and best of all God.' This attitude must exist again"" (trans. Walter Kaufmann).


== Synopsis ==
Demodocus meets Socrates near the stoa of Zeus, and asks for his advice regarding his son, Theages, who desires ""to become wise"" (sophos), something that Demodocus considers dangerous. Socrates suggests that he should speak directly to Theages, who happens to be present, remarking how the boy has a ""holy sounding"" name (Theages, θεός+άγω, means “god-guided"").
Socrates asks Theages what kind specialty is wisdom exactly, and the boy responds that it's the ability to govern men (123e). Socrates suggests to Theages that the art he is looking for is that of the despot, tyrant (τύραννος) in the original text (124e), a word that in Ancient Greek meant autocrat rather than violent oppressor as it does today. Socrates proceeds to tell Theages that this, like all other arts, are learned by associating with those who practice it, which in this case are despots. Theages adds that he does not wish to rule by force like some tyrants do, but by consent (126a), and Socrates, holding to his original position, suggests that someone like Pericles would be most appropriate. Theages however replies that he has actually heard Socrates say that even Pericles could not make his student virtuous (which was truly recorded in the Protagoras dialogue (320a-b)).

Finally Theages suggests that, as rumours will have it, Socrates himself might be the best of teachers, if he would have him as his student. Socrates begins by telling Theages of his daemon, a guiding spirit whose voice he's been hearing since childhood, always telling him what he should not do, rather than what he should. He continues by giving examples of ""prophesies"" he has made with the help of this spirit, and must therefore take his warning seriously. Theages suggests that he could start as Socrates' student, and if the daemon appears to disagree, they could terminate his tutelage, otherwise, continue. Socrates agrees.

Tuina,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Tuina,genus,wikipedia.org,"Tui na ([tʰwéɪ.nǎ]; Chinese: 推拿) is a form of alternative medicine similar to shiatsu. As a branch of traditional Chinese medicine, it is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, moxibustion, fire cupping, Chinese herbalism, tai chi or other Chinese internal martial arts, and qigong.


== Background ==
Tui na is a hands-on body treatment that uses Chinese Daoist principles in an effort to bring the eight principles of traditional Chinese medicine into balance. The practitioner may brush, knead, roll, press, and rub the areas between each of the joints, known as the eight gates, to attempt to open the body's defensive qi (wei qi) and get the energy moving in the meridians and the muscles. Techniques may be gentle or quite firm. The name comes from two of the actions: tui means ""to push"" and na means ""to lift and squeeze."" Other strokes include shaking and tapotement. The practitioner can then use a range of motion, traction, and the stimulation of acupressure points. These techniques are claimed to aid in the treatment of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions, as well as many non-musculoskeletal conditions.
As with many other traditional Chinese medical practices, different schools vary in their approach to the discipline. In traditional Korean medicine it is known as chu na (推拏), and it is related also to Japanese massage or anma and its derivatives shiatsu and sekkotsu. In the West, tui na is taught as a part of the curriculum at some acupuncture schools.


== Efficacy ==
A collaborative study between researchers in China and Germany concluded that the use of Tui na techniques can be a safe, low-cost method to reduce back and neck pain.

Talara,genus,wikipedia.org,"Talara is a city in the Talara Province of the Piura Region, in northwestern Peru. It is a port city on the Pacific Ocean with a population of 91,444 as of 2017. Its climate is hot and dry. Due to its oil reserves, and ability to produce aviation fuel, Talara hosted a United States air base during World War II. It was also one of two refueling stations for the Pacific Fleet. There were naval guns on the hills, and submarine nets in the harbor. The Ajax, Achilles and Exeter, three British destroyers, were refuelled there on their way around the Horn to catch the Graf Spee in Rio de la Plata.  Talara is also home to a large fishing fleet. The city is served by the Cap. FAP Víctor Montes Arias Airport.
Talara is the westernmost city in all of mainland South America. (A small outlying town, Seccion Dieciocho, is situated slightly further west, and just beyond there, the land itself reaches its westernmost extent at Punta Pariñas.)  Talara and some neighbouring cities (Piura and Amotape) served as the backdrop for the short novel Who Killed Palomino Molero? by Mario Vargas Llosa.

But if the moths themselves were not like the wasps one might argue that it was accidental that the habits were so alike, but the general appearance and structure are in conjunction with the habits so alike that in the species of Pseudosphex it is impossible to distinguish moth from wasp on the flower-heads of Ageratum conyzoides unless one is within eighteen inches or so, while on the wing at any distance it is quite impossible to distinguish them ... the species of Pseudosphex are mimics of the highest degree.""

Phaenarete,genus,wikipedia.org,"Phaenarete (Greek Φαιναρέτη, born c. 484 BC), wife of Sophroniscus, was the mother of the Greek philosopher Socrates and his half-brother, Patrocles.  (Since Sophroniscus had died before 424 BC, he was probably Phaenarete's first husband, while Chaeredemus, father of Patrocles, was her second). Historian of philosophy Debra Nails puts Phaenarete's birthdate around 484 BC, as she must have been old enough to give birth to Socrates in 469 and yet young enough to give birth to Patrocles about 450.  She was apparently alive at the time of the Euthydemus, which was set in or after 407.
The name Phaenarete means ""She who brings virtue to light"", and it is, according to A.E. Taylor, ""suggestive of good family connexions"", based on its appearance in the genealogy of the immortal Amphitheus in Aristophanes' Acharnians.
Very little is known of the life of Phaenarete. In Plato's Theaetetus, Socrates compares his own work as a philosopher with hers as a maia (midwife).  According to John Burnet, the role of maia was ""performed by women of good family""

Patalene,genus,wikipedia.org,"Patalene (Ancient Greek: Παταληνή) or Pattalene (Ancient Greek: Πατταληνή) was an ancient area of the Indian subcontinent, now in modern Pakistan, that corresponds to the area of Sind.
The Indo-Greeks are mentioned in ancient sources as having occupied the areas of the Patalene (Sindh) and Gujarat, including the strategic harbour of Barygaza (Bharuch), conquests also attested by coins dating from the Indo-Greek ruler Apollodotus I and by several ancient writers (Strabo 11; Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap. 41/47):

The Greeks... took possession, not only of Patalene, but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of Saraostus and Sigerdis.
Ptolemy mentioned Patalena in his Geographia:

Moreover the region which is next to the western part of India, is called Indoscythia. A part of this region around the (Indus) river mouth is Patalena, above which is Abiria. That which is about the mouth of the Indus and the Canthicolpus bay is called Syrastrena. (...) In the island formed by this river are the cities Pantala, Barbaria. (...) The Larica region of Indoscythia is located eastward from the swamp near the sea, in which on the west of the Namadus river is the interior city of Barygaza emporium. On the east side of the river (...) Ozena-Regia Tiastani (...) Minnagara"".

Petelia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Petelia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Petilia or Petelia (Ancient Greek: Πετηλία) was a city name found in some ancient works of classical antiquity. It's widely accepted that in antiquity there were two cities with this name, both located in Southern Italy. One of them, Petilia, was located in ancient Lucania (today's Basilicata and Campania), while the second one, Petelia, was located on the coast of Bruttium (today's Calabria).


== Petilia (Lucania) ==
Strabo states that Petilia had a prestigious status among Lucanians, even though the same author, in his work Geographica, often mistakes Petilia with Petelia. According to modern scholars, Petilia was probably the city whose remains are found on Monte Stella. This last discovery was made by historian Giuseppe Antonini (1683–1785), based on some inscriptions reportedly found on the same site. Monte Stella is now a military area and permissions for archaeological excavations are not granted easily.


== Petelia (Bruttium) ==
During the Second Punic War, Petelia remained a Roman ally, while all of the other Bruttian cities had gone over to Hannibal. After a long siege, it was taken by the Carthaginians, its people expelled and replaced by other Bruttians; but following the Roman victory its original population was restored. Petelia's remains might be located in today's Petilia Policastro or Strongoli. The Petelia Gold Tablet was discovered near Strongoli in the nineteenth century.
Some historians claim that Ancient Petelia already was a bishopric, established perhaps in 546 or then adopting the city's new medieval name Strongoli, but without solid evidence, and the see is never mentioned in the Byzantine imperial Notitia Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which most dioceses in Calabria belonged to in the 9th till 11th centuries, so the diocese's foundation may rather date from the Normans, probably late 12th century.

Plynteria,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Plynteria,genus,wikipedia.org,"Plynteria (Gr. πλυντήρια) was a festival of ancient Greece celebrated at Athens every year, on the 22nd of Thargelion, in honor of Athena Polias, with the heroine Aglauros (or with the two combined as Athena Aglauros),  whose temple stood on the Acropolis.  The festival's name came from plynein (πλύνειν), a Greek verb meaning ""to wash"".
Plutarch states that the festival took place on the 25th, but probably only because it lasted for several days.  The day of this festival was at Athens among the apophrades (ἀποφράδες) or dies nefasti, that is, impure days on which temples were closed and business was not done.  During the festival the temple of Athena was surrounded by a rope to preclude all communication with it.  Her statue was stripped of its garments and ornaments so that they might be ritually cleaned, and was in the meanwhile covered over to conceal it from the sight of man.  The genos of women who performed this service were called praxiergidai (πραξιεργίδαι).  The city was therefore, so to speak, on this day without its protecting divinity, and any undertaking commenced on it was believed to be necessarily unsuccessful.  A procession was also held on the day of the Plynteria, in which a quantity of dried figs, called hegetoria (ἡγητορία), was carried around.
The Plynteria is thought to have originated in Ionia, where some communities had a month named Plynterion.

Zale,genus,wikipedia.org,"The Zale Corporation (best known as Zales) is an American jewelry retailer, incorporated in Delaware in 1993. The principal executive offices are located in Coppell, Texas.


== History ==
The company began in 1924 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when the two Russian-Jewish immigrant brothers Morris (M. B.) Zale and William Zale (born Zalefsky/Zalewski), along with Ben Lipshy opened the first Zales Jewelers store (now a division in the multi-division company).
As a marketing strategy, the Zale brothers instituted a credit plan whereby customers could pay ""a penny down and a dollar a week"", making jewelry and other merchandise affordable for the average working American. The success of this credit policy led to the company expanding to a total of 12 stores in Oklahoma and Texas by 1941. Zales Jewelers moved its headquarters from Wichita Falls to Dallas in 1946. In 1998, online shopping was opened at www.zales.com.


== Corporate restructuring ==
In 1957, Zales Jewelers opened its first store in a shopping center—a major shift from operating only in downtown locations. The same year, Zales announced the initial public offering of its stock (ZLC) and began trading its public shares on the American Stock Exchange in 1958. In 1989, Zale acquired Gordon's Jewelers, which had been a major competitor. Zales bought the Skillern Drug pharmacy chain in the 1960s, but sold it in 1980.
Until 1986, Zales operated a catalog showroom called O. G. Wilson.
In 1986, People's Jewelers bought Zales.
On January 1, 1992, Zale filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
In 1999 and 2000, Zale expanded with two major acquisitions: Peoples Jewellers of Canada and Piercing Pagoda.
In 2007, the company divested its Bailey Banks & Biddle brand to Finlay Enterprises.
In February 2014, Signet Jewelers agreed to buy Zale Corporation, with Zale shareholders receiving US$21 a share in cash in US$1.3 billion deal. The merger created a $6.2 billion firm.
In January 2017, Zales announced it would close a handful of its mall stores when the leases expire, to avoid duplication with former rival Kay Jewelers.
In 2018, the company moved its headquarters to a new building in Coppell, Texas.

Mursa,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Mursa,genus,wikipedia.org,"Osijek (Croatian pronunciation: [ôsijeːk] ) is the fourth-largest city in Croatia, with a population of 96,848 in 2021. It is the largest city and the economic and cultural centre of the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia, as well as the administrative centre of Osijek-Baranja County. Osijek is on the right bank of the Drava River, 25 km (16 mi) upstream of its confluence with the Danube, at an elevation of 94 m (308 ft).


== Name ==
The name was given to the city due to its position on elevated ground, which prevented the city being flooded by the local swamp waters. Its name Osijek derives from the Croatian word oseka 'ebb tide'. Due to its history within the Habsburg monarchy and briefly in the Ottoman Empire, as well as the presence of German, Hungarian, and Serbian minorities throughout its history, Osijek has (or had) its names in other languages: Hungarian: Eszék, German: Essek, Esseg, or Essegg, Turkish: Ösek, and English: Esgek.
Its Roman name was Aelia Mursa, Mursa, and later Mursa Major, which may be a form of the pre-existing name. Etymologically, mursa may be a variant of Moras from the Proto-Indo-European word *móri 'sea, marshland' (cf. morass), or it may come from the root mur 'wall', indicating a fortified place.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
The origins of human habitation in the Osijek area date back to Neolithic times, with the first known inhabitants belonging to the Illyrians and, in the second
half of the fourth century BC, invading Celtic tribes, the Scordisci.
After the conquest of Pannonia, Osijek, known at the time as Mursa, was under the administration and protection of the Roman 7th legion, which maintained a military castrum at the colony and a bridge over the river Drava. There is evidence that the Roman emperor Hadrian established the settlement from scratch, regardless he raised  Mursa to the status of a colony with special privileges in 133. After that, Mursa had a turbulent history, with several decisive battles taking place at its immediate proximity, among which the most notable are the battle between Aureolus and Ingenuus in 260 and the especially brutal and bloody Battle of Mursa Major in 351. These battles, especially the latter one, had long-term consequences for the colony and the region, which was already under ever-increasing pressure from the invading Goths and other invading tribes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the destruction of local tribes by Avar Kaghanate in sixth century, this area was resettled by Slavic tribes.
The earliest recorded mention of Osijek dates back to 1196. The town was a feudal property of Kórógyi family between 1353 and 1472. After the death of the last Kórógyi, King Matthias Corvinus granted it to the Rozgonyi family. The city was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman army on 8 August 1526, just before the Battle of Mohács. It was invested with a Turkish garrison in 1529. The Turks rebuilt it in Ottoman oriental style and it was mentioned in the Ottoman census of 1579. In 1566, Suleiman the Magnificent built a famous, 8-km-long wooden bridge of boats in Osijek, considered at that time to be one of the wonders of the world. In Ottoman Empire, Osijek was part of the Sanjak of Pojega, Budin Eyalet, and became a commercial center as an important conduit for East-West trade.
Following the Second Battle of Mohács in 1687, Osijek was taken by the Habsburg monarchy on 29 September 1687, after more than 150 years of Ottoman rule.

.


=== Habsburg Empire ===

Osijek was restored to western rule on 29 September 1687, when the Turks were ousted and the city was occupied by the Habsburg Empire. Between 1712 and 1715, Austrian authorities built a new fortress, outer walls, and all five planned bastions (authored by the architect Maximilian de Gosseau) known as Tvrđa, in the heart of the town. Holy Trinity Square is surrounded on the north by the building of the Military Command, on the west by the Main Guard building and on the east by the Magistrate building (presently Museum of Slavonia). In the middle of the square, a monument to the plague was erected in 1729 by General Maximilian Petras' widow.
The Gornji Grad (""Upper Town"") was founded in 1692 and Donji Grad (""Lower Town"") followed in 1698 settled mostly by the inhabitants from swampy area of Baranja. Tvrđa, Gornji Grad, and Donji Grad continued as separate municipalities until 1786, when they were united into a single entity. In the late 18th century, it took over from Virovitica as the centre of the Virovitica County. The Habsburg empire also facilitated the migration and settlement of German immigrants into the town and region during this period. A particular German city dialect, Essekerisch, formed.
In 1809, Osijek was granted the title of a Free Royal City, and during the early 19th century, it was the largest city in Croatia. The city developed along the lines of other central European cities, with cultural, architectural and socioeconomic influences filtering down from Vienna and Buda. At the beginning of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the town was held by the Hungarians, but on 4 February 1849, it was taken by the Austrians under General Baron Trebersberg.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Osijek was the seat of the Virovitica County of the autonomous territory Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in Austria-Hungary.
During the 19th century, cultural life mostly revolved around the theatre, museums (the first museum, Museum of Slavonia, was opened in 1877 by private donations), collections, and printing houses (the Franciscans). City society, whose development was accompanied by a prosperous economy and developed trade relations, was related to religious festivals, public events (fairs), entertainment, and sports. The Novi Grad (New Town) section of the city was built in the 19th century, as well as Retfala to the west.


=== Twentieth century ===
The newest additions to the city include Sjenjak, Vijenac Ivana Meštrovića, Novi Grad and Jug II, which were built in the 20th century. The city's geographical riverside location, and noted cultural and historical heritage – particularly the baroque Tvrđa, one of the most immediately recognizable structures in the region – facilitated the development of tourism. The Osijek oil refinery was a strategic bombing target of the Oil Campaign of World War II.
After the war, the local German-speaking populace was expelled. The daily newspaper Glas Slavonije was relocated to Osijek and has been printed there ever since. A history archive was established in the city in 1947 and GISKO (city library) in 1949. A children's theatre and an art gallery were opened, and the volunteer fire department DVD ""Hrvatska Elektroprivreda"" founded, in 1950 (separate from the DVD ""Vodovod"" founded in 1947). As a continuation of the tradition of promoting national heritage, especially in music, society of culture and art, ""Pajo Kolarić"" was established on 21 March 1954.
Osijek has been connected with the Croatian republic's capital Zagreb and the previous federal capital Belgrade by a modern paved road since 1958. The new Drava bridge to the north was built in 1962.
The first faculty opened in Osijek was Faculty of Economy (in 1959 as Centre for economic studies of the Faculty of Economy in Zagreb), followed immediately by a high school of agriculture, later renamed as Faculty of Agriculture and Faculty of Philosophy. The Faculty of Law was established in 1975. thus becoming the first new member of newly established University of Osijek.
As part of further development as a regional food industry and agricultural centre, a major (working) collective for agriculture and industry was established in 1962. During the 1980s, a new pedestrian suspension bridge over the Drava was built. A regional centre of National Television JRT was also opened.


==== Croatian War of Independence ====

During the war in Croatia, from 1991 to 1995, the city sustained damage by Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and local Serbs, especially to the centre and Co-cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul and to the periphery. About 800 people were killed in the shelling of the town from August 1991 to June 1992. Overall, a total of 1,724 people from Osijek were killed over the course of the war, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians. At least five Croatian officials were condemned for war crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek, including General Branimir Glavaš.

== Institutions and industries ==

Major institutions in the city include the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek (established in 1975), the Croatian National Theatre, the Museum of Slavonia (established in 1877), and the printing house dating to 1735. The city also has several gymnasiums, the oldest of which dates to 1729, a drawing school from the 19th century, a zoological garden, a centre for the promotion of livestock breeding, and an institute for sugar beet farming.
The Saponia chemical factory is the largest factory in the Osijek area. It is a major producer of detergents, soap and cosmetics whose products are recognized throughout the region as being of quality. It is by far the largest exporter in the city area. Other industries include a regional brewery, the Pivovara Osijek (first Croatian beer), a sugar processing plant, as well as a candy factory Kandit. The Niveta brush factory founded as Siva in 1922 still operates.
The Osijek area used to be much more industrialised and a broad range of goods and products were being manufactured there. One of the earliest factories was the Drava match factory, established in 1856, which no longer exists.
Other industries included production of synthetic materials, agricultural machinery, metal furniture, wood and timber, textiles, footwear, and silk, as well as metal processing and printing. However, the 1990s saw most of these industries decline and in some cases close completely. However, the city remains at the centre of an important agricultural region.


== Politics ==

At the November 2007 elections, no party held a majority, which is not unusual for Croatia as local elections have proportional representation. However, the three mathematically possible coalitions had political problems that made coalition building unusually difficult. The November elections were early (izvanredne) elections caused by the breakdown of the coalition of the two main parties, the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) and the Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB). The cause of the breakdown was disagreement over the building of a new sports stadium.
At the elections held on 25 November 2007, the HSP and the HDSSB gained 7 seats each, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 6 seats, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) 4, and the Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS) 1.
A possible coalition between HDSSB and SDP provoked criticism of the Social Democrats for lack of principle such as from Damir Kajin, who called it a 'sellotape coalition', alluding to the charges of war crimes that the HDSSB leader Branimir Glavaš is facing. After the parties failed to agree on a coalition, the Croatian government called new elections for the city. These elections took place on 9 March 2008 and gave the HSP 9 councilors, the HDSSB 6, HDZ, 5, SDP, 3 and a coalition of HNS and two smaller parties 2. Anto Đapić has expressed his hope for a coalition with the HDZ.


=== Minority councils ===
Directly elected minority councils and representatives are tasked with consulting tasks for the local or regional authorities in which they are advocating for minority rights and interests, integration into public life and participation in the management of local affairs. At the 2023 Croatian national minorities councils and representatives elections Albanians, Hungarians, Germans, Slovaks and Serbs of Croatia each fulfilled legal requirements to elect 15 members minority councils of the City of Osijek while Bosniaks, Macedonians, Montenegrins of Croatia elected individual representatives.


== Society and culture ==


=== Cultural events ===
Numerous events take place in the city throughout the year. The most important of them are the Croatian Tambura Music Festival (in May), attended by tambura orchestras from all over Croatia and the Osijek Summer Nights (during June, July and August), a series of cultural and entertainment programs in the open, accompanied by food and fairs. The Day of the City of Osijek is celebrated with a cultural and artistic activities and exhibitions.
The surroundings of Osijek provide opportunities for hunting and angling on the Drava river and its backwaters. Hunting in the area known as Kopački Rit (in Baranja) is famous beyond the borders of Croatia.


=== Cuisine ===
The abundance of game and agriculture has made Osijek the country's semi-official gastronomical capital. Local dishes include traditional Slavonian-style specialities (kulen, paprika-flavoured sausage, other kinds of sausages, ham, bacon, dairy products), as well as boiled dumplings, venison, slavonski čobanac and fish dishes such as the famous riblji paprikaš (fish stew made with paprika).

Aglaonice,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Aglaonice,genus,wikipedia.org,"Aglaonice (Ancient Greek: Ἀγλαονίκη, Aglaoníkē, compound of αγλαὸς (aglaòs) ""luminous"" and νίκη (nikē) ""victory"") was an ancient Thessalian witch, known from a scholion on the Argonautica and two references in Plutarch's Moralia. She was the daughter of Hegetor or Hegemon.  Her date is uncertain, but she may have been active some time between the mid-third century BC and the late-first century AD. However, Richard Stothers suggests that Aglaonice might have been mythical, or a pre-fifth century figure about whom legends had developed by the time of Plutarch.
Thessalian witches were famous in the for their ability to draw down the moon from the sky. Both Plutarch and the scholiast on the Argonautica claim that Aglaonice was able to predict lunar eclipses, and planned her drawing down of the moon to coincide with them.  As during a normal lunar eclipse the moon remains visible, Peter Bicknell proposed that during Aglaonice's lifetime there were particularly dark eclipses, which would explain how her ability to predict eclipses would help make the illusion of drawing down the moon convincing. However, Bicknell's theory has been criticised both on the grounds of its astronomical implausibility, and for over-literally interpreting ancient literary evidence.
According to the scholiast on the Argonautica, Aglaonice's drawing down of the moon was the source of the proverb ""pull the moon against yourself"", meaning to bring misfortune upon yourself.


== Cultural influence ==
One of the craters on Venus is named after Aglaonice. She is one of the 999 mythical or historical figures featured on Judy Chicago's Heritage Floor, associated with the place-setting for Aspasia in The Dinner Party.

Achaea,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Achaea,genus,wikipedia.org,"Achaea () or Achaia (), sometimes transliterated from Greek as Akhaia (Αχαΐα, Akhaḯa, Greek: [axaˈia]), is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of Western Greece and is situated in the northwestern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. The capital is Patras which is the third largest city in Greece.


== Geography ==

Achaea is bordered by Elis to the west and southwest, Arcadia to the south, and Corinthia to the east and southeast. The Gulf of Corinth lies to its northeast, and the Gulf of Patras to its northwest. The mountain Panachaiko (1926 m), though not the highest of Achaea, dominates the coastal area near Patras. Higher mountains are found in the south, such as Aroania (2341 m) and Erymanthos (2224 m). Other mountain ranges in Achaea are Skollis, Omplos, Kombovouni and Movri. Its main rivers ordered from west to east are the Larissos, Tytheus, Peiros, Charadros, Selinountas and Vouraikos. Most of the forests are in the mountain ranges, though several are in the plains including the extreme west. There are grasslands around the mid-elevation areas and barren lands in the highest areas.


== Climate ==
Achaea has hot summers and mild winters. Sunny days dominate during the summer months in areas near the coast, while the summer can be cloudy and rainy in the mountains. Snow is very common during the winter in the mountains of Erymanthos, Panachaiko and Aroania. Winter high temperatures are around the 10 °C mark throughout the low-lying areas.


== Administration ==

The regional unit Achaea is subdivided into 5 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):

Aigialeia (2)
Erymanthos (4)
Kalavryta (5)
Patras (Patra, 1)
West Achaea (Dytiki Achaia, 3)


=== Prefecture ===
As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Achaea was created out of the former prefecture Achaea (Greek: Νομός Αχαΐας). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.


=== Provinces ===
Province of Aigialeia - Aigio
Province of Kalavryta - Kalavryta
Province of Patras - Patras
Note: Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.


== History ==


=== Classical Antiquity ===

The Achaean League was a Hellenistic-era confederation of city states in Achaea, founded in 280/281 BC. It later grew until it included most of Peloponnese, much reducing the Macedonian rule in the area.
After Macedon's defeat by the Romans in the early 2nd century BC, the League was able finally to defeat a heavily weakened Sparta and take control of the entire Peloponnese. However, as the Roman influence in the area grew, the league erupted into an open revolt against Roman domination, in what is known as Achaean War. The Achaeans were defeated at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC), and the League was dissolved by the Romans.
In AD 51/52, Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus was proconsul of Achaea, and is portrayed (under the name ""Gallio"") in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible, as presiding over the trial of the Apostle Paul in Corinth (Acts 18:12–17).


=== Medieval history ===

Achaea remained a province of the Byzantine Empire after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In the 6th and 7th centuries, Slavs invaded Greece and reached the Peloponnese, settling there. The coastal cities remained largely under Byzantine control, and a Siege of Patras in 805/807 failed. By the end of the 9th century, the whole peninsula was firmly under Byzantine control again, forming the Theme of the Peloponnese. 
After the Fourth Crusade several new Crusader states were founded in Greece. One of these was the Principality of Achaea, founded in 1205, which like the Roman province covered a much larger area than the Achaea region. The Achaea region was among the core territories of the Principality, with four baronies: the extensive Barony of Patras, the Barony of Vostitsa, the Barony of Chalandritsa, and the Barony of Kalavryta. Patras, under the powerful Latin Archbishopric of Patras, over time became a semi-autonomous domain under the protection of Venice and the Holy See. Although Kalavryta was lost to the Byzantine Greeks already by the end of the 13th century, the other baronies survived until the Principality of Achaea was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 1430, and became part of the Despotate of the Morea.
The Despotate of the Morea fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1460. As a part of the Morean War, the Republic of Venice captured Achaea in 1687 and held it until 1715, when the Ottomans recaptured the Peloponnese. Under Ottoman rule, Achaea was part of the Morea Eyalet.


=== Modern history ===
In the Greek War of Independence, Aigio was one of the first cities to be liberated by the Greeks and all of Achaea was liberated by the end of 1821. Achaea produced several heroes including Kanaris, Zaimis and Roufos and prime ministers of Greece including Andreas Michalakopoulos as well as some head of states.
In the first administrative subdivision of independent Greece, Achaea was part of the Achaea and Elis Prefecture. This was divided into the prefectures of Achaea and Elis in 1899. Achaea and Elis were reunited in 1909, and split again in 1930.
Achaea saw an influx of refugees that arrived from Asia Minor during the Greco Turkish War of 1919-1922. Tens of thousands were relocated to their camps in the suburbs of Patras and a few villages mainly within the coastline. One of the camps was named Prosfygika.


== Population ==

Achaea today has about one-third of the population of the Peloponnese. Patras, the capital of Achaea, is the third largest city in Greece, behind Athens and Thessaloniki. Two-thirds of the Achaean population live near Patras, and more than half within the city limits. The main industrial areas are around Patras.


=== Main towns and cities ===

The main cities and towns of Achaea are (ranked by 2021 census population of the town proper):

Patras 169,886
Aigio 19,857
Kato Achaia 7,689


== Culture ==

The monastery Agia Lavra is situated a few kilometres west of Kalavryta on the top of a hill. 12 to 20 km east, is Cave Lakes, with lakes inside. The length is around 300 to 500 m.
The mountain hosts the most modern Greek telescope, named Aristarchus (after the ancient Greek astronomer - Aristarchus of Samos) and operated by the National Observatory of Athens. A narrow gauge railway track runs for 30 km, mainly as a tourist attraction. The track begins near Kalavryta and ends off Diakopto.


== Economy ==
Patras is one of the main industrial and commerce centers in Greece. Temeni is a place where the spring water Avra (Άυρα) is manufactured. It is owned by Tria Epsilon, a division of The Coca-Cola Company and a parent. There is a small oil refinery near Rio. Athenian brewery has the largest production facility of the company in Patra.


== Transport ==


=== Roads ===

Stenia,genus,wikipedia.org,"The grass moth genus Stenia is probably a junior synonym of Dolicharthria; see there.

Stenia is a genus in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It was established by John Lindley in 1837. These epiphytic plants occur in warm, humid habitats of Trinidad and the Amazonian slope of the northern Andean region in South America.
This genus as a rule lacks pseudobulbs and consequently produces tufted fan-like growths of fairly erect narrow, short leaves, and conforms to the sympodial method of growth.
Stenia plants produce a short, creeping or erect, single-flowered inflorescences, growing laterally. The flowers are medium-sized, with equal petals and sepals. All members of this genus have their flowers dominated by the large, shoe-like, concave labellum (lip) with a disc-like, toothed crest. The flowers have four elongate pollinia, with the upper pollinia long and narrow. They occur at any time of the year, though slightly more concentrated during summer in cultivation.


== Species ==
Though this genus has been known to science since the early 19th century, most species were not discovered until the late 20th century.

Arica,genus,wikipedia.org,"Arica ( ə-REE-kə; Spanish: [aˈɾika]) is a commune and a port city with a population of 222,619 in the Arica Province of northern Chile's Arica y Parinacota Region. It is Chile's northernmost city, being located only 18 km (11 mi) south of the border with Peru. The city is the capital of both the Arica Province and the Arica and Parinacota Region. Arica is located at the bend of South America's western coast known as the Arica Bend or Arica Elbow. At the location of the city are two valleys that dissect the Atacama Desert converge: Azapa and Lluta. These valleys provide citrus and olives for export.
Arica is an important port for a large inland region of South America. The city serves a free port for Bolivia and manages a substantial part of that country's trade. In addition it is the end station of the Bolivian oil pipeline beginning in Oruro. The city's strategic position is enhanced by being next to the Pan-American Highway, being connected to both Tacna in Peru and La Paz in Bolivia by railroad and being served by an international airport.
Arica has an extremely dry climate, with almost no rainfall. Even so, the frequent maritime winds from the cold waters nearby renders a moderate desert climate. Its mild weather has made Arica known as the ""city of the eternal spring"" in Chile while its beaches are frequented by Bolivian society. The city was an important port already during Spanish colonial rule. Chile seized the city from Peru in 1880 during the War of the Pacific, being recognized as Chilean by Peru in 1929. A substantial part of African Chileans live in or trace their origins to Arica.


== History ==
Archaeological findings indicate that Arica was inhabited by different native groups dating back 10,000 years. These people are the first known culture to mummify their dead, predating the Egyptians by 2,000 years, and their mummies have been discovered as recently as 2004 and buried as shallow as <1 meter beneath the city's surface.


=== Colonial period ===
Spaniards settled the land under captain Lucas Martinez de Begazo in 1541, and in 1570, the area was grandly retitled as ""La Muy Ilustre y Real Ciudad San Marcos de Arica"" (the very illustrious and royal city of San Marcos of Arica). At the time of the Spanish settlement the region around Arica was already multiethnic displaying a mix of local sedentary populations and mitma settlers from the Altiplano. The proportions of these are that the first made up about 66% of the population and the latter 25%. The remaining 9% were fishing-oreinted people known as Camanchacos. Many of the sedentary populations are thought to have  spoken the Puquina language. In 1540 the encomienda system was established in Arica and its sorroundings with conquistador Lucas Martínez de Vegaso obtaining 1,638 encomienda indians (a third of tributaries distributed). Pedro Pizarro and Pedro de la Fuente followed in numbers receiving each approximately 600 tributaries. 
By 1545, Arica was the main export entrepot for Bolivian silver coming down from Potosí, which then possessed the world's largest silver mine. Arica thus held a crucial role as one of the leading ports of the Spanish Empire. These enviable riches made Arica the target for pirates, buccaneers, and privateers, among whom Francis Drake, Thomas Cavendish, Richard Hawkins, Joris van Spilbergen, John Watling, Baltazar de Cordes, Bartholomew Sharp, William Dampier, and John Clipperton all took part in looting the city. From 1540 to 1570 the population in the region of Arica shrank by 36% due to disease, death in mining or emigration to evade the harsh conditions imposed by the Spanish. In 1570 the Francisco de Toledo issued a decree reorganizing indigenous labour and taxation and among other things imposing the mita minera. 


=== Peruvian period (1821–1880) ===
Following the collapse of Spanish rule, in 1821, Arica was part of the recently independent Peruvian Republic. The Peruvian Constitution of 1823 regards it as a province of the Department of Arequipa. In 1855, Peru inaugurated the Arica-Tacna railroad (53 km long), one of the first in Latin America. The rail line still functions today.

The earthquake of August 13, 1868 struck near the city with an estimated magnitude of 8.0 to 9.0. Estimates on the death toll vary greatly, some estimates have the number at 25,000 to 70,000 people. Others estimate that the population of Arica was less than 3,000 people and the death toll was around 300. It triggered a tsunami, measurable across the Pacific in Hawaii, Japan and New Zealand. As Arica lies very close to the subduction zone known as the Peru–Chile Trench where the Nazca Plate dives beneath the South American Plate, the city is subject to megathrust earthquakes.


=== Chilenization period (1880–1929) ===

Chilean forces occupied the region following the War of the Pacific. The Treaty of Ancón in 1883 formally acceded the region to Chilean control. The 1929 Tacna-Arica compromise in the Treaty of Lima subsequently restored Tacna to Peru but Arica remained part of Chile.


=== Modern Arica (1929–present) ===
In 1958, the Chilean Government established the ""Junta de Adelanto de Arica"" (Board of Development for Arica), which promulgated many tax incentives for the establishment of industries, such as vehicle assembly plants, a tax-free zone, and a casino, among others.
Many car manufacturers opened plants in Arica, such as Citroën, Peugeot, Volvo, Ford and General Motors, which produced the Chevrolet LUV pickup until 2008.
In 1975, together with Chile's new open economy policies, the ""Junta de Adelanto de Arica"" was abolished.
The Arica and Parinacota Region was created on October 8, 2007, under Law 20.175, promulgated on March 23, 2007, by President Michelle Bachelet in the city of Arica.


=== Promel toxic waste dumpsite ===
In 1984-1985, the Swedish metal company Boliden Mineral AB paid a local mineral extracting company, Promel Ldta., 10 million SEK ($1.2 million, $3.15 million in 2021 dollars) to receive, treat and confine around 20,000 tonnes of smeltery sludge from Rönnskärsverken in Skellefteå, containing among other things high levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and iron and smaller amounts of gold and silver. To earn additional income, Promel planned to extract various substances from the waste at its processing plant at Sitio F in the outskirts of Arica. The end products were mainly raw arsenic and iron-silver-gold oxides. The first shipment arrived in Arica in August 1984 and the processing of 500 kg test batches in October 1984 gave positive results with oversight from an official from the Chilean Health Authority in Santiago. After the sludge processing had begun at large scale and the third and last shipment of sludge arrived to Promel's plant in Arica in July 1985, contact between Boliden and Promel ceased.
In the late 1980s, Promel ceased all activities at Sitio F for unknown reasons and abandoned the remaining 10,000 tons of the highly toxic smelting sludge out in the open exposed to the elements. The area surrounding the plant was later used by the local authorities to build state-sponsored social housing aimed at low-income families. No physical barrier between the former plant and the residential area existed at the time. Residents of the new neighborhood had no knowledge about the contents of the sludge at the site, which became used as a playground by children.
In the 1990s, many residents around the former plant began to show symptoms of lead and arsenic poisoning. In 1998, the Chilean authorities ordered Promel to move the toxic waste. Promel moved the sludge to a walled area on the other side of a nearby hill and covered the material with a plastic mat. It was supposed to be a temporary storage site, yet the material remains there to this day. Cleanup of the remaining parts of Sitio F finished as late as 2010. Even after the removal of the sludge, the health effects on the local population continue to be devastating. Almost 8,000 residents were tested for toxic substances in 2010. Of the 6600 people that got results back from the Chilean Health Authority, 12.9% showed arsenic in their urine samples. Studies have found very high rates of arsenic related lung cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer and skin cancer in the local population. Other health effects include non-cancerous heart and lung diseases and fertility problems such as low birth weights and spontaneous miscarriages.
In 2013, 796 Arica residents, including human rights defenders, started legal action in Sweden against Boliden. The Court of Appeal for Northern Norrland held that the claims of the victims were time limited, and the Swedish Supreme Court declined to hear the case.


== Demography ==

According to the 2017 census by the National Statistics Institute, Arica spans an area of 4,799.4 km2 (1,853 sq mi) and has 222,619 inhabitants (110,115 men and 112,504 women). The population grew by 20% (37,351 people) between the 2002 and 2017 censuses. Arica is home to 97.7% of the total population of the region.
The population of Arica is made up of various long-established groups in the region, and other more recent arrivals settled at differing times. Among the long-established groups, the oldest consists of indigenous Amerindians, such as the Aymara, whose presence in the region is of several millennia. These are followed by the second oldest, the local colonial-era groups, which includes local mestizos (of mixed Spanish-Amerindian origin), local criollos (whites of colonial Spanish origin), and local afrodescendants of colonial-era slaves. The third oldest group consists of early post-colonial Chinese Chileans who first arrived as miners and rail workers in the 1890s.
These long-established groups of Ariqueños have been augmented by various later settlers, mostly other criollos and mestizo Chileans from elsewhere around Chile, but also numerous Europeans, who arrived in the 1900s, including more Spaniards arriving from Spain, as well as Italians, Greeks, British, and French. These arrived at different times during the last century.
Some Ariqueños, primarily the indigenous Amerindians, but also the afro-descendants, share cultural affinities to counterpart populations in neighbouring border areas of Peru, and more distantly, Bolivia.
The urban area of Arica has 175,441 inhabitants in an area of 41.89 km2. Arica in 2007 had more than 185,000 inhabitants (not counting the inhabitants of the valleys and Lluta Azapa, with that reach almost to the 194.000 inhabitants). The growing city of Arica spreads outward into the desert and the Peru-Chile border. The Azapa Valley has developed a year-round agricultural economy due to improvements in irrigation and transportation of its products.
The villages that make up the commune are Villa Frontera and San Miguel de Azapa. Some hamlets are Poconchile, Molinas, Sora, Las Maitas and Caleta Vitor.
Arica was made famous in 1970 by the spiritual master Oscar Ichazo when he held a 10-month training there for 50 North Americans from the Esalen Institute in California.  The Arica School, based in the United States of America, has influenced thousands of people all over the world.
The commune of Arica is composed of 19 census districts.

=== Notable residents ===
Jean-François Dauxion-Lavaysse, a Frenchman, born in 1770 or 1775, died on 8 July 1829 in Arica. He was the first director of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History and the Botanical Garden.
Dante Poli – former footballer
Hipólito Unanue – physician, and briefly President of Peru
Izkia Siches, former Vice president and minister of the interior of Chile.

== Economics ==
Arica is the economical powerhouse of its region. It is an enormous trade and shipping point and vital for the maritimal access of Bolivia.


== Features ==

The Morro de Arica is a tall, nearly-vertical rock formation and hill located in the city, situated approximately 139 meters above sea level. It was the last bulwark of defense for the Peruvian troops who garrisoned the city. It was attacked and captured on 7 June 1880 by Chilean troops, as the final effort of their Campaña del Desierto (Desert Campaign) during the War of the Pacific.
Near to the city center is the Azapa Valley, an oasis where vegetables and, famously, Azapa olives are grown. Economically, it is also an important port for Chilean ore. The semi-tropical latitude, combined with the low humidity and the city's beaches, have made Arica a popular tourist destination. It is also a center of Chilean rail networks with Bolivia. For air travel, the region is serviced by Chacalluta International Airport.
Arica has strong ties with the city of Tacna, Peru. Many people cross the border daily as they travel between the two cities, partially due to the many services (for example, dentists, doctors, etc.) that are cheaper in Peru. Arica is connected to both Tacna and to La Paz via separate railroad lines.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Climate ==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Arica has a hot desert climate, abbreviated ""BWh"" on climate maps. Unlike many other cities with arid climates, Arica seldom sees extreme temperatures throughout the course of the year and it is also relatively overcast. Arica is also known as the driest inhabited place on Earth, at least as measured by rainfall: average annual precipitation is 0.76 mm (0.03 inches), as measured at the airport meteorological station.


== Administration ==
As a commune, Arica is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008–2012 alcalde is Waldo Sankán Martínez (Independent).
Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Arica is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Vlado Mirosevic (Partido Liberal) and Mr. Luis Rocaful as part of the 1st electoral district, which includes the entire Arica and Parinacota Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by José Miguel Insulza (PS, 2018–2026) and José Durana (UDI, 2018–2026) as part of the 1st senatorial constituency (Arica and Parinacota Region and Tarapacá Region).


== Sports ==
Arica was one of the four host cities of the 1962 FIFA World Cup, and it was the venue for a Rip Curl Pro Search surfing event that took place from June 20 to July 1, 2007.
Arica plays host to a leg of the International Bodyboarding Association's world tour event every year at the notorious ""el flops"" surf break. The event has been running since 2004.


== Tourist attractions ==
Morro de Arica: the prominent mount rising above the city, affording sweeping views.
Catedral de San Marcos de Arica: the magnificent church designed by Gustave Eiffel was built in the 1870s.
Plaza Colón: the civic heart of the city, the public square is where its residents congregate for celebrations, diversions or just being a part of the community.
Other attractions include the former house of the Governor, the Former Arica Custom House, railway station Arica-La Paz, the Archaeological and Anthropological Museum of San Miguel de Azapa, Sea and Historical Arms and Arica. For evening entertainment there is the Casino de Arica.


=== Beaches ===
More than 20 km of beaches, many known for the quality of surfing, span across the Coastal Range in the northern sector. The harbored location makes these beaches unique from other cities in Chile in terms of topography.
From north to south the beaches are located Las Machas, Chinchorro, del Alacrán, El Laucho, La Lisera, Brava, Arenillas Negras, La Capilla, Corazones and La Liserilla.


=== Other tourist sites ===

Chungará Lake: Arica is the main access road to the lake, the 29th highest in the world (and the 10th highest in South America), with an approximate height of 4517 metres. It is located within the Lauca National Park.
Pucará de Copaquilla: about 3,000 metres above sea level, dates from the 12th century, declared National Monument, located on a promontory that serves as the defence has a double stone wall, which protects a series of internal spaces. From this point it is possible to observe the pre-and streams.
Termas de Jurasi a few miles southeast of Putre, by Ruta 11-CH, turning off a dirt road. Underground waters are home to temperatures above 40 °C (104 °F) which are reputed to have medicinal properties.
Surf Arica is a world-famous spot for surfing. The wave known as ""El Gringo"" hosts surfing and bodyboarding world championships every year. In 2007, Arica was the site for an ASP world tour contest. Others stops on this tour include Hawaii, Tahiti, Fiji and South Africa.


== Transport ==

Passenger train services on the Arica–La Paz railway ceased in 1996, but as of 2017 there were proposals to restart services from Arica as a tourist attraction (and for freight).
In 2011, Chile announced plans to privatise the Port of Arica. These were opposed by Bolivia, as Arica is its main sea port.
Chacalluta International Airport is the main airport in Arica and is located 18.5 km north of the city. LATAM Chile, Amaszonas, JetSmart, and Sky Airline have scheduled commercial service to several Chilean airports.

Bendis,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Bendis,genus,wikipedia.org,"Bendis (Ancient Greek: Βένδις) was a Thracian goddess associated with hunting and the moon. Worship of the goddess seems to have been introduced into Attica around 430 BC. In Athens, Bendis was identified with the goddess Artemis, but she had a separate temple at Piraeus, near the temple of Artemis, and was a distinct goddess.  She was a huntress, like Artemis, but was often accompanied by dancing satyrs and maenads, as represented on a fifth-century red-figure stemless cup at Verona.
The Greeks wrote of Bendis as one of the seven daughters of Zeus who were turned into swans who would later reappear in human forms driving a golden carriage and teaching crowds.


== Etymology ==
The deity's name, Bendis, is thought to derive from a Proto-Indo-European stem *bʰendʰ-, meaning 'to bind, unite, combine'.


== Worship ==
By a decree of the Oracle of Dodona, which required the Athenians to grant land for a shrine or temple, her cult was introduced into Attica by immigrant Thracian residents, and, though Thracian and Athenian processions remained separate, both cult and festival became so popular that in Plato's time (c. 429–413 BC) its festivities were naturalized as an official ceremonial of the city-state, called the Bendideia (Βενδίδεια). Among the events were night-time torch-races on horseback, mentioned in Plato's Republic, 328:

""You haven't heard that there is to be a torchlight race this evening on horseback in honour of the Goddess?"" ""On horseback?"" said I. ""That is a new idea. Will they carry torches and pass them along to one another as they race with the horses, or how do you mean?"" ""That's the way of it,"" said Polemarchus, ""and, besides, there is to be a night festival which will be worth seeing.""

In Piraeus there was a temple of the goddess which was called the Bendidia / Bendideion (Βενδίδειον).
A red-figure skyphos, now at Tübingen University, of c. 440–430, seems to commemorate the arrival of the newly authorized cult: it shows Themis (representing traditional Athenian customs) and a booted and cloaked Bendis, who wears a Thracian fox-skin cap.

A small marble votive stele of Bendis, c. 400–375 BC, found at Piraeus, (pictured left) shows the goddess and her worshippers in bas-relief. The image shows that the Thracian goddess has been strongly influenced by Athenian conceptions of Artemis: Bendis wears a short chiton like Artemis, but with an Asiatic snug-sleeved undergarment. She is wrapped in an animal skin like Artemis and has a spear, but has a hooded Thracian mantle, fastened with a brooch. She wears high boots. In the fourth century BC terracotta figurine (pictured right) she is similarly attired and once carried a (wooden?) spear. 

 
Elsewhere in Greece, the cult of Bendis did not catch on.

Just as in all other respects the Athenians continue to be hospitable to things foreign, so also in their worship of the gods; for they welcomed so many of the foreign rites that they were ridiculed for it by comic writers; and among these were the Thracian and Phrygian rites. (Strabo, Geography (1st century AD), 10.3.18)

The ""Phrygian rites"" Strabo mentioned referred to the cult of Cybele that was also welcomed to Athens in the 5th century.


== Related deities ==
The Athenians may have blended the cult of Bendis with the equally Dionysiac Thracian revels of Kotys, mentioned by Aeschylus and other ancient writers. Archaic female cult figures unearthed in Thrace (modern-day Bulgaria) have also been identified with Bendis.
Bendida Peak on Trinity Peninsula in Antarctica is named after the goddess.

Tinea,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Tinea,genus,wikipedia.org,"About 40 types of fungus can cause dermatophytosis. They are typically of the Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton type. Risk factors include using public showers, contact sports such as wrestling, excessive sweating, contact with animals, obesity, and poor immune function. Ringworm can spread from other animals or between people. Diagnosis is often based on the appearance and symptoms. It may be confirmed by either culturing or looking at a skin scraping under a microscope.
Prevention is by keeping the skin dry, not walking barefoot in public, and not sharing personal items. Treatment is typically with antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or miconazole. If the scalp is involved, antifungals by mouth such as fluconazole may be needed.
Dermatophytosis has spread globally, and up to 20% of the world's population may be infected by it at any given time. Infections of the groin are more common in males, while infections of the scalp and body occur equally in both sexes. Infections of the scalp are most common in children while infections of the groin are most common in the elderly. Descriptions of ringworm date back to ancient history.",1159

Patania was long considered a junior synonym of Syllepte, but in 2007 it was removed from this synonymy and reinstated as a valid genus. With this action, Patania became the senior synonym to the widely used genus name Pleuroptya, making the latter a junior subjective synonym. Since then, the genus underwent further taxonomic changes, such as the transfer of some species to the reinstated genus Nagiella.

Angitia,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Angitia,genus,wikipedia.org,"Angitia was a goddess among the Marsi, the Paeligni and other Oscan-Umbrian peoples of central Italy. She was associated in antiquity with snake-charmers who claimed her as their ancestor. Roman interpretations probably obscure her Marsian significance.
Angitia's myths vary. According to Gnaeus Gellius (late 2nd century BC), Angitia was one of the three daughters of Aeëtes, along with Medea and Circe, two of the most famed sorceresses of Greek myth. Circe, as widely known from the Odyssey, practiced transforming spells; Medea ended up in Italy, where her son ruled over the Marsi. Angitia lived in the area around the Fucine lake and specialized in curing snakebites.
Angitia is attested by inscriptions in the territory of the Marsi and elsewhere in the Central Apennines. She is named in three inscriptions from Luco dei Marsi, in antiquity known as Lucus Angitiae, ""Sacred Grove of Angitia."" The earliest is a dedication to the goddess ""on behalf of the Marsic legions,"" dating to the late 4th century BC. The name also appears on a dedicatory cippus from Civita d'Antino, in the Umbrian Iguvine Tablets, and in inscriptions in the territories of the Paeligni, Vestini, and Sabines. She is mentioned along with Angerona in one inscription, and in another her name appears in the plural. Another indicates that she had a temple and a treasury. The Romans derived her name from anguis, ""serpent,"" hence the form Anguitia.
As snakes were often associated with the healing arts in antiquity (see, for instance, rod of Asclepius), Angitia is believed to have been mainly a goddess of thaumaturgy.  She had powers of witchcraft, magic and medicine being regarded as complementary in the ancient world, and was a master in the art of miraculous and herbal healing, especially when it came to snakebites. She was also attributed with a wide range of powers over snakes, including the power to kill snakes with a touch.
According to the account given by Servius, Angitia was of Greek origin, for Arigitia was the name given by the Marrubians to Medea, who after having left Colchis came to Italy with Jason and taught the people the above-mentioned remedies. Silius Italicus identifies her as Medea.

Doxa,genus,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Doxa,genus,wikipedia.org,"Doxa (Ancient Greek: δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν, dokein, 'to appear, to seem, to think, to accept') is a common belief or popular opinion. In classical rhetoric, doxa is contrasted with episteme ('knowledge').


== Etymology ==
The term doxa is an ancient Greek noun (δόξα) related to the verb dokein (δοκεῖν), meaning 'to appear, to seem, to think, to accept'.
Between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC, the term picked up an additional meaning when the Septuagint used doxa to translate the Biblical Hebrew word for ""glory"" (כבוד, kavod). This Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures, as used by the early Church, led to frequent use of the term in the New Testament. The word is also used in the worship services of the Greek Orthodox Church, where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. The unification of these multiple meanings of doxa emerges in the modern terms orthodoxy and heterodoxy. This semantic merging in the word doxa is also seen in the Russian word slava (слава), which means 'glory', but is used with the meaning of praise or worship in words like pravoslavie (православие), meaning ""orthodoxy"" (or, literally, ""true belief"", ""true way of worship"") related to the verb 'славить' – ""to praise"" but calqued from the Greek ὀρθοδοξία (orthodoxia).


== In philosophy ==


=== Plato ===
In his dialogue Gorgias, Plato presents the sophists as wordsmiths who ensnared and used the malleable doxa of the multitude to their advantage without shame. In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul. 
This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's theory of forms, which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form. Plato's framing of doxa as the opponent of knowledge led to the classical opposition of error to truth, which has since become a major concern in Western philosophy. (However, in the Theaetetus and in the Meno, Plato has Socrates suggest that knowledge is orthos doxa for which one can provide a logos, thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief."") Thus, error is considered in as pure negative, which can take various forms, among them the form of illusion.

While doxa is used as a tool for the formation of arguments, it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by James A. Herrick in The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction:The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy. Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon (and therefore also constrained by) the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not homogeneous, nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing ""truths.""


=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle, Plato's student, objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge (episteme), as doxa had found applications in the physical world, whereby those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it. Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as endoxa. Endoxa is a more stable belief than doxa, because it has been ""tested"" in argumentative struggles in the Polis by prior interlocutors. The term endoxa is used in Aristotle's Organon, Topics and Rhetoric.
Aristotle conceives of doxa as a type of hupolêpsis. Knowledge also falls under this category. Categorizing doxa, or opinion, with knowledge suggests that doxa is rational.


=== Epicurus ===
The Principal Doctrines (Kyriai Doxai) are the main beliefs of the Epicurean school of Hellenistic philosophy, and constitute Epicurean orthodoxy. They are believed to be the authoritative conclusions arrived at by Epicurus, Metrodorus, and their close companions during the early years of the formation of the school, which were compiled into an epitome for the benefit of their disciples.


== Contemporary interpretations ==


=== In sociology and anthropology (Bourdieu) ===
Pierre Bourdieu, in his Outline of a Theory of Practice (1972), used the term doxa to denote a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths. In comparison, opinion is the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed. Bourdieu believes that doxa derives from socialization, as socialization also deals with beliefs that derive from society; as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct. Adding on to his previous example, Bourdieu contends that it is a socially-accepted misconception that if you do not score as high as someone else, then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. In the case of common beliefs in school, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than they, may use drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief: it also has the potential to give rise to common action. This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation. Doxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.
