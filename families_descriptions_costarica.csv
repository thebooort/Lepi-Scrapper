Adelidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Adelidae are members of the Superfamily Incurvarioidea. There are more than 300 species in this family distributed worldwide (except for New Zealand), with 13 species in Canada and the United States. Adelids are best known for their enormously long antennae, often 2.5 to 3 times the forewing length. Antennae are usually much longer in the male. Adults of some groups are small, diurnal, and brightly colored, while adults of other groups are crepuscular or nocturnal and dull colored. Both sexes have a well-developed proboscis for nectar. Females insert eggs into the base of the ovaries of unopened flowers or into leaves. Little is known about the larval biology of these relatively conspicuous moths. Larvae of some species construct flat, portable cases of silk covered by debris and feed on fallen or lower leaves of host plants.",841
Adelidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Adelidae or fairy longhorn moths are a family of monotrysian moths in the lepidopteran infraorder Heteroneura. The family was first described by Charles Théophile Bruand d'Uzelle in 1851. Most species have at least partially metallic, patterned coloration and are diurnal, sometimes swarming around the tips of branches with an undulating flight. Others are crepuscular and have a drab coloration. Fairy longhorn moths have a wingspan of 4–28 millimeters, and males often have especially long antennae, 1–3 times as long as the forewing.
They are widespread around the world and can be found over much of North America and Eurasia from April to June. About 50 species occur in Europe, of which most widely noted is the green longhorn (Adela reaumurella) which can sometimes reach great abundance; due to climate change its peak flying season is shifting towards spring. In general, they are more plentiful in the Northern Hemisphere, but the family occurs in the Neotropics, sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and Australia too.
Adelidae appear in certain plants, in which the females insert their eggs or just lay among leaf litter, and the caterpillars make a case, completing their development on the ground. Fairy longhorn moths feed in sunshine on nectar from the flowers of herbaceous (woody) plants.


== Systematics ==
Fairy longhorn moths belong to the superfamily Adeloidea, one of the basal (""monotrysian"") branches of the advanced moth infraorder Heteroneura. By lepidopteran standards, they are thus still rather primitive micromoths. But like other Heteroneura, they already possess the apomorphic sucking proboscis – usually considered a defining feature of Lepidoptera, but the most ancestral moths still live on solid food which they chew.
The Adelidae were previously placed as the subfamily Adelinae within the family Incurvariidae.


=== Subfamilies ===
The Adelidae are usually divided into two subfamilies, but most genera are of uncertain or basal relationships. Selected species are also listed:

Subfamily Adelinae

Adela Latreille, 1796
Adela croesella
Adela reaumurella – green longhorn
Cauchas Zeller, 1839
Cauchas rufimitrella
Nemophora Illiger & Hoffmannsegg, 1798 (tentatively placed here)
Nemophora degeerella – longhorn moth
Nemophora metallica
Nemophora ochsenheimerella
Subfamily Nematopogoninae

Ceromitia Zeller, 1852 (tentatively placed here)
Ceromitia iolampra
Nematopogon
Incertae sedis

Subclemensia
Trichofrons
The genus Tridentaforma is sometimes placed among the Adelidae incertae sedis too; others assign it to the closely related Prodoxidae.

Megalopygidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The flannel moths or crinkled flannel moths (scientific name Megalopygidae) are a family of insects.


== Distribution and habitat ==
There is only one species of Megalopyge in the eastern United States, although there are several throughout the Neotropics. Only five species of the family are known to exist in Florida: three species of Lagoa and one species each of Megalopyge and Norape. While 236 species of Megalopyge are found from Mexico to Argentina, only 11 species have been identified in North America north of Mexico. Only the New World is home to the Megalopygae.


== Life cycle and behavior ==
Adult flannel moths are stout-bodied, and very hairy. Females have thin antennae while males' are feather-like. Larvae are called puss caterpillars and, with their long hairs, resemble cotton balls.  They are eaten by green lacewing insects and the Anolis lizards. They have venomous spines that can cause a painful sting and inflammation lasting for several days. In some cases, the sting may cause headache, nausea, and shock-like symptoms. Perhaps the most notorious for stinging is the caterpillar of Megalopyge opercularis. Caterpillars have seven pairs of prolegs, while other Lepidopterae have five or fewer pairs. They feed on a wide variety of deciduous trees and shrubs.

Mimallonidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Mimallonidae are the sole family of the Superfamily Mimallonoidea. They are primarily distributed in the New World tropics, with about 200 species described and 4 species found in North America. Mimallonid adults are medium to large, stout bodied, hairy moths with broad wings (wingspan 2-5 cm). Larvae are thick in the middle, tapering toward ends. Later stages build unique, open-ended cases or ""sacks"" of silk and leaves in which larvae overwinter. Pupation is in late spring.",483
Mimallonidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Mimallonidae (mimallonids), sometimes known as ""sack-bearer"" moths for the larval case-building behavior, are a family of Lepidoptera containing over 300 named species in 43 genera. These moths are found only in the New World, with most taxa occurring in the Neotropics. Adult moths are externally similar to those belonging to some of the other Macroheterocera families Bombycoidea and Drepanoidea, and thus have been variously treated as belonging to either one of these or other superfamilies.


== Distribution ==
Mimallonids are restricted to the New World, and are distributed in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean (Cuba and The Bahamas). The vast majority of genera and species are found in the tropical regions of the New World, with only five described species from the United States.


== Biology ==
Not much has been published on the natural history of adult Mimallonidae, though most species are thought to be nocturnal. At least three species have diurnal males. Young caterpillars live inside of folded leaves or beneath silken networks, and build portable or semi-portable cases out of silk, frass, and plant material as they grow. The cases are open on either end and vary from irregular in structure to spindle-shaped. The openings of the cases can be blocked by the head and/or the flattened anal plate of the last segment of the body. The sack-like case-making behavior of the caterpillars have earned them the common name ""sack-bearers"".
Mimallonidae larvae feed on several families of plants, including (but not limited to): Anacardiaceae, Clusiaceae, Combretaceae, Fagaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Research at the Area de Conservación, Guanacaste, Costa Rica has resulted in the rearing of many species of Mimallonidae, including some from several additional families of plants.


== Systematics and evolution ==
The current consensus, especially in works based on phylogenetic results, consider Mimallonidae to be the sole family of Mimallonoidea. Other phylogenetic studies of all major Lepidoptera lineages support the placement of Mimallonidae as sister to all Macroheterocera, but within the broader clade Obtectomera. This phylogenetic placement means that mimallonid moths are not more closely related to any one family of Lepidoptera, but are equally related (share a common ancestor with) all members of the extremely diverse clade Macroheterocera. Morphological features, particularly of the larvae, support the uniqueness of this family and distinctness from Macroheterocera.
The systematic relationships with Mimallonidae have been subject to two revisions, resulting in two different classification schemes. William Schaus revised the family and named most of the genera, he then separated the genera into two subfamilies: Lacosominae and Mimalloninae. These subfamilies were based on the presence (Lacosominae) or the absence (Mimalloninae) of the frenulum. It was later realized that this character varies within genera, and thus was deemed a sympleisiomorphy. Using molecular phylogenetics, specifically with the technique of anchored hybrid enrichment, the family was reorganized based on the recognition and naming of robustly supported clades, which were further strengthened with morphological apomorphies. The clades which were robustly supported across all analyses were assigned subfamily status, resulting in recognition of seven subfamilies in Mimallonidae. Using both molecular and morphological phylogenetics, all 42 genera (including some newly described ones) were assigned to the named clades. The 300+ species of the family, too, have been formally classified according to their phylogenetic arrangement.
Recently, many of the species formally placed in the genus Cicinnus have been transferred to Gonogramma, making Gonogramma one of the most diverse mimallonid genera.

== Importance to humans ==
Mimallonidae have been reported as pests of some economically significant crops. In Surinam, Mimallo amilia has been noted as a pest of guava (Psidium gaujava). In Brazil, M. amilia is a known pest of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urophylla) and Psychocampa callipius a pest of cashew (Anacardium occidentale).
In addition to some Mimallonidae species being regarded as pests, others have been considered as potential biological controls of invasive plants. Species belonging to the genus Druentica have been considered as potential control agents of Miconia calvescens (where it is invasive throughout the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Australia) and Clidemia hirta in Hawaii. Aceclostria mus has been evaluated as a potential control agent of the Brazilian pepper tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) in the United States.

Erebidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,The Erebidae are members of the superfamily Noctuoidea. This family was formerly a subfamily of Noctuidae but it now includes several other former subfamilies of Noctuidae.,172
Erebidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Adult moths of Erebidae have quadrifid forewings and usually quadrifine hindwings, meaning that each wing includes a cubital vein that splits into four (explained further in the Classification section). The tribe Micronoctuini instead has bifine hindwings (meaning this same vein splits into two). Aside from this, adult Erebidae usually have an unscaled clypeofrons and broad forewings, and the hindwings often have patterns. Scoliopteryginae, Calpinae and some Erebinae have modified proboscises to pierce fruit skins. Lymantriinae and some Arctiina (Arctiinae) instead have a highly reduced proboscis. The overall appearance may be colourful (e.g. Arctiinae, Aganainae) or cryptic (e.g. Herminiinae).
Larvae are usually smooth in appearance, but larvae of Arctiinae (woolly bears) and Lymantriinae are hairy. Larvae of Arctiinae and Lymantriinae have fully developed prolegs, Aganainae and Herminiinae have fully developed or slightly reduced prolegs, and prolegs in some other subfamilies are reduced or absent as an adaptation to arboreal living (semi-loopers).",1066

Limacodidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Limacodids are members of the Superfamily Zygaenoidea, and there are about fifty North American species in this family. They are medium to medium-small moths with stout, often hairy bodies, and broad, rounded wings. Most are brown or yellowish with contrasting forewing markings. Adults have small heads, short labial palps, and short or absent maxillary palps and probosces. Typical wingspan is 1.5-4.3 cm. Larvae can be naked or densely hairy, and they usually have stinging hairs. These caterpillars move like slugs, gliding on their prolegs and suckers. They feed on a variety of woody and herbaceous plants and overwinter in loose, oval cocoons.",654
Limacodidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Limacodidae or Eucleidae  are a family of moths in the superfamily Zygaenoidea or the Cossoidea; the placement is in dispute. They are often called slug moths because their caterpillars bear a distinct resemblance to slugs.  They are also called cup moths because of the shape of their cocoons.
The larvae are often liberally covered in protective stinging hairs, and are mostly tropical, but occur worldwide, with about 1800 described species and probably many more as yet undescribed species.


== Description ==


=== Moths ===
They are small, hairy moths, with reduced or absent mouthparts and fringed wings. They often perch with their abdomens sticking out at 90° from their thoraces and wings. North American moths are mostly cryptic browns, sometimes marked with white or green, but the hag moth mimics bees.


=== Pupae ===
The final instar constructs a silk cocoon and hardens it with calcium oxalate excreted from its Malpighian tubules. Cocoons have a circular escape hatch, formed from a line of weakness in the silk matrix. It is forced open just prior to emergence of the adult.


=== Caterpillars ===
The larvae are typically very flattened, and instead of prolegs, they have suckers. The thoracic legs are reduced, but always present, and they move by rolling waves rather than walking with individual prolegs. They even use a lubricant, a kind of liquefied silk, to move.
Larvae might be confused with the similarly flattened larvae of lycaenid butterflies, but those caterpillars have prolegs, are always longer than they are wide, and are always densely covered in short or long setae (hair-like bristles). The head is extended during feeding in the lycaenids, but remains covered in the Limacodidae.
Many limacodid larvae are green and fairly smooth (e.g. yellow-shouldered slug), but others have tubercles with urticating hairs and may have bright warning colours. The sting can be quite potent, causing severe pain.
The larval head is concealed under folds. First-instars skeletonise the leaf (avoiding small veins and eating mostly one surface), but later instars eat the whole leaf, usually from the underside. Many species seem to feed on several genera of host plants.
Limacodidae larvae in temperate forests of eastern North America prefer glabrous leaves, presumably because the trichomes of pubescent leaves interfere with their movement.

Noctuidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Noctuids are members of the Superfamily Noctuoidea. Worldwide in distribution, this family is the largest in the Lepidoptera and has approximately 20,000 species. About 2,900 of these are found in North America, and there is wide variation in appearance and behavior. Most moths are gray to brown in color and have line or spots on their wings. Some species are brightly colored. They are small to large in size, and most species are medium-sized with wingspans 2 - 4.5 cm. When at rest, adults of most species hold their wings above their bodies like a roof. Noctuids are typically nocturnal, though some species are diurnal. Most larvae feed on plant foliage, dead leaves, lichens, and fungi; many are serious forest pests. Some species are leaf miners, others are stem- or leaf-borers, and still others feed at night on plant shoots. Noctuid moths pupate in cells in soil, in plant cavities, or in silk cocoons.",918
Noctuidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Adult: Most noctuid adults have wings with a variety of shades of browns, grays, and other varied shades and colourations but some subfamilies, such as Acronictinae and Agaristinae, are very colorful, especially those from tropical regions (e.g. Baorisa hieroglyphica). They are characterized by a structure in the metathorax called the nodular sclerite or epaulette, which separates the tympanum and the conjunctiva in the tympanal organ. It functions to keep parasites (Acari) out of the tympanal cavity. Another characteristic in this group is trifine hindwing venation, by reduction or absence of the second medial vein (M2).
Markings present on the wings of noctuid adults can be helpful in distinguishing species.  From the basal location to the outer edge (proximal to distal) on the forewing, there is a claviform (club-shaped) stigma, horizontally oriented with the thicker end closer to the wing's outer edge, located posterior to a discal (round) stigma.  These are followed distally by a reniform (kidney-shaped) stigma, which is typically oriented with its concave side facing the wing's outer edge.  It is often not possible to discern all of the stigmata on all specimens or species.  Crossbands or crosslines may be present, oriented longitudinally from the leading to the trailing edge of the wing.
Larva: Commonly green or brown; some species present bright colors, such as the camphorweed cucullia moth (Cucullia alfarata). Most are pudgy and smooth with rounded short heads and few setae, but there are some exceptions in some subfamilies (e.g. Acronictinae and Pantheinae).
Pupa: The pupae most often range from shiny brown to dark brown. When they newly pupate they are bright brownish orange, but after a few days start to get darker.
Eggs: Vary in colors, but all have a spherical shape.",1811

Nepticulidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,The Nepticulidae is a family of small moths that occur worldwide. They are characterized by having eye caps over the eyes. This group contains some of the smallest moths in the world with wingspans of only 3 mm. The tiny larvae to this group are mostly leafminers.,264
Nepticulidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The minute larvae usually are leaf miners but some species also mine seeds or bark of trees. The Pectinivalvinae, characterised by a ""pectinifer"" on the valve of the male genitalia, are endemic to Australia, where they mine the leaves of the tree families Myrtaceae (Scoble, 1983) or Cunoniaceae (Eucryphiaceae), and Elaeocarpaceae (Hoare, 2000). This Australian group probably constitutes the sister group of other pigmy moths (the subfamily Nepticulinae), which is distributed around the world except Antarctica (Davis, 1999). Many species undoubtedly await description, especially in tropical areas.
Typical nepticulid moth leaf mines referable to the genera Stigmella and Ectoedemia are known from mid-Cretaceous fossils around 97 million years old.",753

Lasiocampidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"Lasiocampid moths are medium-sized with hairy bodies that usually exceed hindwing in length. Wingspan is 2.5-5.8 cm., and ocelli are absent. In both sexes, the antennae are bipectinate to the tips. When resting, these moths hold their wings like a roof over their bodies. Larvae are colorful, longitudinally striped, and densely hairy. Some species are serious pests in forests and on shade trees. Larvae of some species build communal webs (or ""tents"") in trees for protection from predators, leaving these webs to feed on foliage of the host tree, and other deciduous trees and shrubs. Moths of this family pupate in a cocoon. Silk from some species has been used for cloth, but it is carded and spun - a different technique than used for silk from the Silkworm Moth.",769
Lasiocampidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Caterpillars of this family are large and are most often hairy, especially on their sides. Most have skin flaps on their prolegs and a pair of dorsal glands on their abdomens. They feed on leaves of many different trees and shrubs, and often use these same plants to camouflage their cocoons. Some species are called tent caterpillars due to their habit of living together in nests spun of silk.
As adults, the moths in this family are large bodied with broad wings and may still have the characteristic elongated mouth parts, or have reduced mouthparts and not feed as adults. They are either diurnal or nocturnal. Females lay a large number of eggs which are flat in appearance and either smooth or slightly pitted. In tent caterpillars, the eggs are deposited in masses and covered with a material that hardens in air. Females are generally larger and slower than the males, but the sexes otherwise resemble each other. Moths are typically brown or grey, with hairy legs and bodies.

A family of moths mostly of large size. Palpi porrect and generally large; proboscis absent; eyes small; antennae bipectinate in both sexes; legs generally with minute terminal pairs of spurs to mid and hind tibia and rather hairy. Fore wing with vein 1a not forked with b; 1c rarely present; the cell medial in position; veins 6 and 7 from the angle; veins 9 and 10 always stalked and from beyond the angle. Hind wing with two internal veins; 6 and 7 arising very near the base; 8 curved and almost touching 7 or connected with it by a bar, thus forming a precostal cell; accessory costal veinlets generally present. Frenulum absent. Larva with lateral downwardly-directed tufts of hair, and often subdorsal tufts or dorsal humps on anterior somites thickly clothed with hair. Cocoon closely woven of silk and hair.",1803

Hyblaeidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Hyblaeidae are the ""teak moths"", a family of insects in the Lepidopteran order. The two genera with about 18 species make up one of the two families of the Hyblaeoidea superfamily (the other family being the monotypic Prodidactidae), which in the past has been included in the Pyraloidea. 
Recent phylogenetic studies find varying relationships of Hyblaeoidea among Ditrysian Lepidoptera: Mutanen et al. (2010) find the superfamily to group either with Pyraloidea, or – more often – with Thyridoidea or butterflies. The results of Wahlberg et al. (2013) and Heikilä et al. (2015) indicate a sister-group relationship with Pyraloidea.
Males have a specialised ""hair-pencil"" on the hindleg.
The genus Hyblaea is distributed throughout the Old World tropics, and Torone in the Neotropics. Caterpillar host plants are well known and comprise almost exclusively species of the families Bignoniaceae, Verbenaceae, the mangrove families Avicenniaceae and Rhizophoraceae and a few other families.

Hepialidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Hepialidae are members of the Superfamily Hepialoidea. There are more than 600 named species found worldwide, with high diversity in Australia and Africa, and about 20 species in America north of Mexico. Adults are large to very large moths (wingspan 2-25 cm) and include some of the largest Lepidoptera in the world. Adults are short-lived, and species found in North America are typically yellowish, brownish, or grayish. Females carry enormous numbers of eggs. Males form groups that fly together in swarms at dusk as a courtship ritual. Caterpillars are elongate and cylindrical, and live in tunnels in the soil or bore into stems of living trees and shrubs. The complete life cycle takes 1-2 years.",707
Hepialidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Hepialidae are a family of insects in the lepidopteran order. Moths of this family are often referred to as swift moths or ghost moths.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Hepialidae constitute by far the most diverse group of the infraorder Exoporia. The 82 genera contain at least 700 currently recognised species of these primitive moths worldwide. The genera Fraus (endemic to Australia), Gazoryctra (Holarctic), Afrotheora (Southern African), and Antihepialus (African) are considered to be the most primitive, containing four genera and about 51 species with a mostly relictual southern Gondwanan distribution and are currently separated from the Hepialidae sensu stricto which might form a natural, derived group. The most diverse genera are Oxycanus with 78 species, Endoclita with 78 species, andThitarodes with 80 species following a comprehensive catalogue of Exoporia.<1>] The relationships of the many genera are not yet well established; see below for an ordered synonymic generic checklist, and the Taxobox for navigation.


== Morphology and identification ==
The family Hepialidae is considered to be very primitive, with a number of structural differences to other moths including very short antennae and the lack of a functional proboscis or frenulum (see Kristensen, 1999: 61–62 for details). Like other Exoporia the sperm is transferred to the egg by an external channel between the ostium and the ovipore. Other nonditrysian moths have a common cloaca. The moths are homoneurous with similar forewings and hindwings, and are sometimes included as 'honorary' members of the Macrolepidoptera, though archaic they are. Strictly speaking, they are phylogenetically too basal and constitute Microlepidoptera, although hepialids range from very small moths to a wingspan record of 250 mm in Zelotypia. Because of their sometimes large size and striking colour patterns, they have received more popular and taxonomic attention than most ""micros"". Many species display strong sexual dimorphism, with males smaller but more boldly marked than females, or at high elevation, females of Pharmacis and Aoraia show ""brachypterous"" wing reduction.


== Distribution ==

Hepialidae are distributed on ancient landmasses worldwide except Antarctica but with the surprising exceptions of Madagascar, the Caribbean islands and in Africa, tropical West Africa. It remains to be borne out if these absences are real as Aenetus cohici was not long ago discovered in New Caledonia. In the Oriental and Neotropical regions hepialids have diversified in rainforest environments, but this not apparently the case in the Afrotropics. Hepialids mostly have low dispersive powers and do not occur on oceanic islands with the exception of Phassodes on Fiji and Western Samoa and a few species in Japan and Kurile Islands. Whilst the type locality of Eudalaca sanctahelena is from the remote island of St Helena, this is thought to be an error for South Africa.


== Behaviour ==
Swift moths are usually crepuscular and some species form leks, also thought to have arisen independently in the genus Ogygioses (Palaeosetidae). In most genera, males fly swiftly to virgin females that are calling with scent. In other genera, virgin females ""assemble"" upwind to displaying males, which emit a pheromone from scales on the metathoracic tibiae. In such cases of sex role reversal, there may be visual cues also: males of the European ghost swift are possibly the most frequently noticed species, being white, ghostly and conspicuous when forming a lek at dusk. Sometimes they hover singly as if suspended from a thread or flying in a figure of eight motion. The chemical structures of some pheromones have been analysed.


== Biology ==
The female does not lay its eggs in a specific location but scatters (""broadcasts"") them while in flight, sometimes in huge numbers (29,000 were recorded from a single female Trictena, which is presumably a world record for the Lepidoptera). The maggot-like larvae feed in a variety of ways. Probably all Exoporia have concealed larvae, making silken tunnels in all manner of substrates. Some species feed on leaf litter, fungi, mosses, decaying vegetation, ferns, gymnosperms and a wide span of monocot and dicot plants. There is very little evidence of hostplant specialisation; whilst the South African species Leto venus is restricted to the tree Virgilia capensis this may be a case of ""ecological monophagy"". A few feed on foliage (the austral 'oxyacanine' genera which may drag foliage into their feeding tunnel: Nielsen et al., 2000: 825). Most feed underground on fine roots, at least in early instars and some then feed internally in tunnels in the stem or trunk of their hostplants. Root-feeding larvae travelling through soil make silk-lined tunnels. Before pupating they make a vertical tunnel, which can be up to 10 cm deep, with an exit close to the ground surface. The pupae can then climb up and down to adjust to changes in temperature and flooding. Before the adult moth emerges, the pupa protrudes half way out at the ground surface. The pupa has rows of dorsal spines on the abdominal segments as in other lower members of the  Heteroneura.


== Economic significance ==
Chinese medicine makes considerable use of the ""mummies"" collected of the caterpillar-attacking fungi Ophiocordyceps sinensis, and these can form an expensive ingredient. The witchetty grub (which are sometimes hepialid larvae) is a popular food source especially among aboriginal Australians. In Central America and South America, hepialid larvae are also eaten. However, some species of Wiseana, Oncopera, Oxycanus, Fraus and Dalaca are considered pests of pastures in Australia, New Zealand, and South America.


== Phylogeny ==
The Hepialidae were identified as having primitive wing venation by John Henry Comstock (1893). In his study of Evolution of the Wings of Insects he shows that the fore and hind wings of Sthenopis (Hepialus) argenteomaculatus maintain a five branched radius while in the remainder of the Lepidoptera the hind wing radius is merged into one vein.  This identifies the Hepialidae as a primitive relict of primitive wing venation.

Hepialidae,family,artfakta.se,"Rotfjärilarna är en förhållandevis stor familj med ungefär 500 beskrivna arter, fördelade på mer än 50 släkten. Familjen är representerad i de flesta delar av världen och är speciellt artrik i de orientaliska och australiska djurgeografiska regionerna där några arter är väldigt stora med ett vingspann på mer än 20 cm. I Europa är 15 eller 16 arter kända och av dessa finns sju i Norden. Rotfjärilar är stora i jämförelse med systematiskt närstående fjärilar, har korta antenner och saknar sugsnabel. Larverna lever nere i marken på ­eller i växtrötter – vilket har gett familjen dess svenska namn – och ibland kan de orsaka skador på odlingar av t.ex. sallat.",661
Heliodinidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Heliodinidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Heliodinidae, commonly known as sun moths, is a family of small moths with slender bodies and narrow wings. Members of this family are found in most parts of the world. Heliodinid moths are brightly coloured day-flying moths. The base of the haustellum is bare. The scales on the head are compact and appear like a shield. Many Heliodinidae raise their hindlegs when resting but this is not a taxonomic feature and several genera like Epicroesa and Lamprolophus do not show this posture. Many Heliodinidae have the inner and outer spurs of the metatibia subequal. The larval host plants of the majority of species are in the Aizoaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Phytolaccaceae, Portulacaceae and Nyctaginaceae, all in the Order Caryophyllales. A few feed on Onagraceae, Araliaceae and Piperaceae. The larvae's feeding strategies include skeletonizing leaves (consumption of most of the leaf while leaving behind the stems), boring into leaf stems, leaf mining, and opportunistically invading cecidomyiid galls. The pupae have long stiff hairs on their back sides.


== Genera ==
The family includes the following genera:


== Former genera ==
Aenicteria
Coracistis
Lamachaera
Percnarcha
Placoptila
Zapyrastra has been listed in the Heliodinidae but is now part of Momphidae.

Hedylidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,,0
Hedylidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Hedylidae, the ""American moth-butterflies"", is a family of insects in the order Lepidoptera, formerly representing the superfamily Hedyloidea. They have traditionally been viewed as an extant sister group of the butterfly superfamily Papilionoidea, but a 2014 phylogenetic analysis has suggested Hedylidae is a subgroup of Papilionoidea, and not a sister group, and are more accurately referred to as butterflies rather than moths. They are represented by a single Neotropical genus, Macrosoma, with 35 currently recognized species.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Hedylidae were previously treated as a tribe of Geometridae: Oenochrominae, the ""Hedylicae"". Prout considered they might even merit treatment as their own family. Scoble first considered them to be a hitherto unrecognised group of butterflies and also suggested Hedylidae might possibly constitute the sister group of the ""true"" butterflies (Papilionoidea), rather than of (Hesperioidea + Papilionoidea). Weintraub and Miller argued against this placement (but see). In 1995, Weller and Pashley found that molecular data did indeed place Hedylidae with the butterflies and a more comprehensive study in 2005 based on 57 exemplar taxa, three genes and 99 morphological characters, recovered the genus Macrosoma as sister to the (""Papilionoidea"" + Hesperioidea). However, the most recent phylogenetic analyses shows that skippers are true butterflies and therefore within the clade Papilionoidea, whereas the hedylids are a sister group that may be closely related to the obtectomeran moths. This is contrary to some earlier studies that had shown both the skippers and hedylids as being nested within the Papilionoidea.
Since there are no obvious gaps between supposed species groups, according to basic morphological structure, Scoble (1986) synonymised the five pre-existing genera of Hedylidae (33 of which had been described in Phellinodes) into the single genus Macrosoma. However, a phylogenetic analysis of all Macrosoma species is still needed.


=== Nomenclatural notes ===
In zoological nomenclature, numerous junior homonyms of Macrosoma (Hübner, 1818) exist, (Macrosoma Leach 1819 (a reptile), Macrosoma de Haan 1826 (Odonata), Macrosoma Robineau-Desvoidy 1830 (Diptera: Muscidae), Macrosoma Brandt 1835 (Coelenterata), Macrosoma Hope 1837 (Coleoptera), Macrosoma Lioy 1864 or 1865 (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), Macrosoma Hammer 1979 (Acarina: Oribatidae). To add to this potential confusion in lists of names, there exist two junior homonyms of Hedyle Guenée, 1857: Hedyle Bergh, 1895 (Opisthobranchia, ""Acochlidioidea"", Hedylopsidae; currently placed in the genus Hedylopsis Thiele, 1931), and Hedyle Malmgren 1865 (a polychaete worm). The sea slug family name ""Hedylidae Bergh, 1895"" (type species Hedyle weberi Bergh, 1895) is thus also invalid.


== Morphology and identification ==
The eggs of hedylid moths have an upright configuration and are variable in shape: in Macrosoma inermis they are particularly narrow and spindle-shaped, resembling those of some Pieridae, and in the case of M. tipulata they are more barrel-shaped, like certain Nymphalidae. The larvae resemble (probably convergently) those of Apaturinae. Adult hedylids resemble geometer moths. They share many morphological and genetic characteristics with both the superfamilies Papilionoidea and the Hesperioidea. The abdomen is very long and slim, like many Neotropical butterflies of the subfamilies Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, hence the name of one Macrosoma species ""heliconiaria"". Unlike other butterflies, however, the antennae are un-clubbed, but rather filiform or bipectinate. Unlike the family Geometridae, in which they had been placed by the geometer expert L.B.Prout, hedylids lack tympanic organs at the base of the abdomen, but have them on the wings (see under Behaviour). Unlike other butterflies, however (except the unique case of the remarkable Australian skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia, whose males possess these structures), the single-spined frenulum and retinaculum are not lost or reduced in males, except in three Macrosoma species where there is no functional wing coupling system. The retinaculum is always lost in females, and the frenulum may be vestigial. The family have been fully catalogued and illustrated in an identification guide.


=== Butterfly-like characteristics of Hedylidae ===
""Mesoscutum"" with ""secondary line of weakness"" near median ""notal"" wing process, as in some representatives of Papilionidea and Hesperioidea (potentially unique butterfly character;
Mesothoracic aorta with horizontal chamber, as in other butterflies (not Papilionidae), but as also in Cossidae;
Metathoracic ""furca"" resembling a blunt arrowhead; this a variable but potentially unique character in butterflies;
Second median plate of forewing base lying partly under the base of vein ""1A+2A"", unlike the configuration in moths;
""Postspiracular bar"" on first abdominal segment;
Female genitalic ""anterior apophyses"" reduced;
Male genitalia relatively ""deep"" dorso-ventrally;
Abdomen curved (especially in males), as in papilionoids;
Abdominal first tergal segment is strongly ""pouched"" (Scoble 1986; as also in Thyatirinae moths;
""Precoxal"" sulcus joining ""marginopleural"" sulcus;
Male Foreleg pretarsus lost, thus fused into two elements as in nymphalid butterflies, with the mid and hindlegs used for perching, but apparently redeveloped in hesperiids;
Egg upright, spindle-shaped and ribbed as in some Pieridae (e.g. the orange tip butterfly), some other butterflies, and as in some moth groups also;
Larva with ""anal comb"", as in some Hesperioidea (not however Megathyminae) and Pieridae, but not in other Papilionoidea except one species (and also independently in Tortricidae), that is used for propulsion of frass away from the caterpillar;
Caterpillar with horn-like processes and a ""bifid"" tail as in many Nymphalidae;
Caterpillar with ""secondary setae"", as in Pieridae;
Ventral larval proleg ""crochet"" hooks not forming a complete circle, unlike configuration in hesperiids and papilionoids;
Pupa affixed to the substrate via a silken girdle around the 1st abdominal segment, like in Pieridae (as also in some Geometridae, especially the subfamily Sterrhinae (in which the girdle is around the abdomen), but lost in many Papilionoidea);
Pupal cocoon lost, as in papilionoids, and a few other groups of Lepidoptera;
""Temporal cleavage line"" lost in the pupa (as in papilionoids).


== Distribution ==
Hedylidae range in North America south from central Mexico and in South America through the Amazon from southern Peru (where there are a full 26 species, up to 12 at a single site: to central Bolivia and southwestern Brazil). In the Caribbean, they also occur in Cuba, Jamaica, and Trinidad.


== Behaviour ==
Hedylids are attracted to artificial lights, but occasionally some species can be found flying by day. Thus, they may be involved in some mimicry complexes with Ithomiinae (e.g. the female only of Macrosoma lucivittata). A few species are white and resemble pierid butterflies (e.g. Macrosoma napiaria). Based on a study of Macrosoma heliconiaria, it has been found that hedylids have tympanic organs on their forewings for hearing apparently homologous to the ""Vogel's organ"" in some Papilionoidea that would help them evade bats at night. They have been shown to exhibit typical moth evasive behaviour towards bats such as erratic spiralling movements and dives. The resting posture is often at a curious angle, with the thorax tilted and the posterior edge of the hindwings nearly touching the substrate (Scoble, 1986). The larvae which lack the prominent horns in the first instar tend to rest on the midrib of the leaf and often skeletonise leaves or at either side produce an untidy patchwork of holes. The elegant pupa is attached by a cremaster and silken girdle and sometimes resembles a bird dropping.


== List of species ==
This list of species is largely based on phenetic characters.


== Biology and host plants ==
The life history of Macrosoma heliconiaria was originally described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into the biology of hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably ""I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I was sure it was a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid"". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span a wide range of (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea). The ""green lizard caterpillar"" Macrosoma tipulata attacks an economically important local fruit tree ""Cupuaçu"" (Theobroma grandiflorum) in Brazil and can defoliate saplings; the biology of this species has been studied and illustrated in some detail. The larva of this species lives about 15 days in 5 instars, the pupal stage lasts about 7 days and the adult lives about 10 days. M. tipulata and many other species can be found as adults through most of the year.


== DNA sequences ==
A few species have been sequenced for the mitochondrial genes ""cytochrome oxidase I"", and ""ND1"" and nuclear genes ""Wingless"" and ""Ef-1"", including Macrosoma semiermis. Some species are currently being barcoded.

Geometridae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Geometer Moths are the second largest family of moths in North America. This family includes many serious agricultural and forest pests. These moths are small to medium in size, with slender bodies and broad wings. On average, the wingspan of these moths is 1-6 cm, though the females of some species lack wings entirely. Larvae are usually twiglike and lack the first 2-3 pairs of prolegs. They move by extending the front of the body as far forward as possible, then bringing the rear of the body up to meet it; this is how they have gotten the name ""inchworm"" or ""measuringworm."" Larvae usually feed externally on leaves and pupate in loose cocoons in leaf litter or soil.",679
Geometridae,family,wikipedia.org,"The geometer moths are moths belonging to the family Geometridae of the insect order Lepidoptera, the moths and butterflies. Their scientific name derives from the Ancient Greek geo γεω (derivative form of γῆ or γαῖα ""the earth""), and metron μέτρον ""measure"" in reference to the way their larvae, or inchworms, appear to measure the earth as they move along in a looping fashion. Geometridae is a very large family, containing around 23,000 described species; over 1400 species from six subfamilies are indigenous to North America alone. A well-known member is the peppered moth, Biston betularia, which has been the subject of numerous studies in population genetics. Several other geometer moths are notorious pests.


== Caterpillars ==
The name ""Geometridae"" ultimately derives from Latin geometra from Greek γεωμέτρης (""geometer"", ""earth-measurer""). This refers to the means of locomotion of the larvae or caterpillars, which lack the full complement of prolegs seen in other caterpillars, with only two or three pairs at the posterior end instead of the usual five pairs. Equipped with appendages at both ends of the body, a caterpillar clasps with its front legs and draws up the hind end, then clasps with the hind end (prolegs) and reaches out for a new front attachment, creating the impression that it measures its journey. The caterpillars are accordingly called ""loopers"", ""spanworms"", or ""inchworms"" after their characteristic looping gait. The cabbage looper and soybean looper are not inchworms but caterpillars of a different family. In many species of geometer moths, the inchworms are about 25 mm (1.0 in) long. They tend to be green, grey, or brownish and hide from predators by fading into the background or resembling twigs. When disturbed, many inchworms stand erect and motionless on their prolegs, further increasing this resemblance. Some have humps or filaments, or cover themselves in plant material. They are gregarious and are generally smooth. Some eat lichen, flowers, or pollen, while some, such as the Hawaiian species of the genus Eupithecia, are carnivorous. Certain destructive inchworm species are referred to as ""cankerworms"".
In 2019, the first geometrid caterpillar in Baltic amber was discovered by German scientists. Described under Eogeometer vadens, it measured about 5 mm (0.20 in) and was estimated to be 44 million years old, dating back to the Eocene epoch. It was described as the earliest evidence for the subfamily of Ennominae, particularly the tribe Boarmiini.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Adults ==
Many geometrids have slender abdomens and broad wings which are usually held flat with the hindwings visible. As such, they appear rather butterfly-like, but in most respects they are typical moths. The majority fly at night. They possess a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They tend to blend into the background, often with intricate, wavy patterns on their wings. In some species, females have reduced wings (e.g. winter moth and fall cankerworm). Most are of moderate size, about 3 cm (1.2 in) in wingspan, but a range of sizes occur, from 10–50 mm (0.39–1.97 in), and a few (e.g., Dysphania species) reach an even larger size. They have distinctive paired tympanal organs at the base of the abdomen (these are absent in flightless females).

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Systematics ==

The placement of the example species follows a 1990 systematic treatment; it may be outdated. Subfamilies are tentatively sorted in a phylogenetic sequence, from the most basal to the most advanced. Traditionally, the Archiearinae were held to be the most ancient of the geometer moth lineages, as their caterpillars have well-developed prolegs. However, it now seems that the Larentiinae are actually older, as indicated by their numerous plesiomorphies and DNA sequence data. They are either an extremely basal lineage of the Geometridae – together with the Sterrhinae – or might even be considered a separate family of Geometroidea. As regards the Archiearinae, some species that were traditionally placed therein actually seem to belong to other subfamilies; altogether it seems that in a few cases, the prolegs which were originally lost in the ancestral geometer moths re-evolved as an atavism.
Larentiinae – about 5,800 species, includes the pug moths, mostly temperate, might be a distinct family.
Sterrhinae – about 2,800 species, mostly tropical, might belong to same family as the Larentiinae.

Gracillariidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Gracillariidae is an important family of insects in the order Lepidoptera and the principal family of leaf miners that includes several economic, horticultural or recently invasive pest species such as the horse-chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
There are 98 described genera of Gracillariidae (see below). A complete checklist is available of all currently recognised species. There are many undescribed species in the tropics but there is also an online catalogue of Afrotropical described species; the South African fauna is quite well known. Although Japanese and Russian authors have recognised additional subfamilies, there are three currently recognised subfamilies, Phyllocnistinae of which is likely to be basal. In this subfamily, the primitive genus Prophyllocnistis from Chile feeds on the plant genus Drimys (Winteraceae), and has leaf mines structurally similar in structure to fossils (see ""Fossils""). While there have been some recent DNA sequence-based studies of Palaearctic species there is need for a satisfactory modern global phylogenetic framework for the subfamilies of Gracillariidae. Some genera are very large, e.g. Acrocercops, Caloptilia, Cameraria, Epicephala and Phyllonorycter.


== Distribution ==
Gracillariidae occur in all terrestrial regions of the world except Antarctica.


== Identification ==
These generally small (wingspan 5–20 mm) moths are leaf miners as caterpillars, which can provide a useful means of identification, especially if the hostplant is known. The subfamilies differ by the adult moth resting posture (Davis and Robinson, 1999). Most Gracillariinae rest with the front of the body steeply raised; Lithocolletinae and Phyllocnistinae rest with the body parallel to the surface; in Lithocolletinae often with the head lowered.
Some additional features can be seen under close examination. The antennal flagellomeres of adults have two rows of scales: a basal row with large scales covering an apical row with smaller scales. The male genitalia has only four pair of muscles and lacks a gnathos. The female ovipositor is short and laterally flattened.


== Life history ==
Most larval Gracillariidae undergo hypermetamorphosis, meaning there is a major change within the larval stage. Early instars have a flattened head and body, modified mandibles, and lack functional spinnerets or legs; these feed on sap. Later instars are cylindrical with round heads, and have chewing mouthparts, legs and functional spinnerets; these feed on plant tissue. Some species additionally have a spinning instar that does not feed, and others have a non-feeding instar before this spinning instar.
The Brazilian Spinivalva gaucha is an exception to this trend, lacking a sap-feeding stage.
Gracillariidae have various lifestyles. Some larvae mine leaves while others instead roll leaves, and there are also larvae which mine other plant parts or form galls.


== Larval hostplants ==
Many host plants are known, generally dicotyledonous trees or shrubs. Patterns of hostplant shifting have been inferred for many United Kingdom species in the genus Phyllonorycter and its sister genus Cameraria. A recent DNA sequencing study mainly of Palaearctic species has shown that the burst of evolutionary adaptive radiation occurred long after that of the larval hostplants, rather than demonstrating a tight coevolutionary process.


== Fossils ==
The family is an old one, with fossil Phyllocnistinae mines known from 97-million-year-old rocks in Kansas and Nebraska. There are other fossil mines known from rocks of Eocene and Miocene age. There are also two adult moths known from Lithuanian or Baltic amber of Eocene age: Gracillariites lithuanicus Kozlov, 1987 and G. mixtus Kozlov, 1987.


== Subfamilies and genera ==

Gracillariidae phylogeny has been revised in 2017 and is now containing eight subfamilies:

Styltmalar är små till medelstora fjärilar, och de är i allmänhet smalvingade eller till och med mycket smalvingade. Många arter har en typisk sittställning genom att de håller främre delen av kroppen lyft från underlaget med frambenen som ”styltor”. Arterna i underfamiljen Lithocolletinae har i de flesta fall starkt glänsande framvingar med orange grundfärg, och de kallas därför för guldmalar.",613
Sphingidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Sphingidae belong to the Superfamily Sphingoidea. Members of this family are commonly called ""hummingbird,"" ""sphinx,"" or ""hawk"" moths, and some can be mistaken for hummingbirds. Most are medium to large moths, with heavy bodies; wingspread reaches 5 inches or more in some species. The Sphingidae are strong and fast fliers, with a rapid wingbeat. Most species in the group are active at dusk, and most feed much like hummingbirds, hovering in front of a flower and sipping nectar through the extended proboscis. The proboscis rolls up when not in use. Some species lack scales on large portions of their wings, resulting in transparent or clear wings. In most species, the larval stage is called a ""hornworm"" because the caterpillar's posterior end has a harmless hook or hornlike appendage protruding upward. Unfortunately, the caterpillar of some species can be very destructive to agricultural crops and ornamental plantings.",933
Sphingidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Sphingid's antennae are generally not very feathery, even in males. They lack tympanal organs, but members of the group Choerocampini have hearing organs on their heads. They have a frenulum and retinaculum to join hindwings and forewings. The thorax, abdomen, and wings are densely covered in scales. Some sphingids have a rudimentary proboscis, but most have a very long one, which is used to feed on nectar from flowers. Most are crepuscular or nocturnal, but some species fly during the day. Both males and females are relatively long-lived (10 to 30 days). Prior to flight, most species shiver their flight muscles to warm them up, and, during flight, body temperatures may surpass 40 °C (104 °F).
In some species, differences in form between the sexes is quite marked. For example, in the African species Agrius convolvuli (the convolvulus or morning glory hawk-moth), males have thicker antennae and more mottled wing markings than females. Only males have both an undivided frenular hook and a retinaculum. Only males have a partial comb of hairs along with their antennae. Females attract males with pheromones. The male may douse the female with a pheromone before mating.",1182

Flera svärmare är återkommande långdistansmigranter.",349
Tineidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Tineidae are a fairly large family of the Superfamily Tineoidea. These are small to medium-sized moths with wingspans of 0.7-3.6 cm. Adults of most species are dark in color, and most have very rough head scales. Some are important pest species, and these are typically pale, with or without markings. These moths typically have wings that are broadly lancelike and somewhat rounded at the tips. In most genera, the venation is complete. Larvae eat a variety of food including dead plant and animal matter, fungi, wool, and similar materials. Most larvae form cases similar to those of casebearers. Acrolophus species feed on roots of grasses and form silken tunnels among them.",682
Tineidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Tineidae is a family of moths in the order Lepidoptera described by Pierre André Latreille in 1810. Collectively, they are known as fungus moths or tineid moths. The family contains considerably more than 3,000 species in more than 300 genera. Most of the tineid moths are small or medium-sized, with wings held roofwise over the body when at rest. They are particularly common in the Palaearctic, but many occur elsewhere, and some are found very widely as introduced species.
Tineids are unusual among Lepidoptera as the larvae of only a very small number of species feed on living plants, the majority feeding on fungi, lichens, and detritus. The most familiar members of the family are the clothes moths, which have adapted to feeding on stored fabrics and led to their reputation as a household pest. The most widespread of such species are the common clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella), the case-bearing clothes moth (Tinea pellionella), and the carpet moth (Trichophaga tapetzella); the brown-dotted clothes moth (Niditinea fuscella) despite its name, preferentially feeds on feathers in bird nests.
One remarkable genus is Ceratophaga, whose members feed exclusively on pure keratin in the form of the horns and hooves of dead mammals and even the shells of dead tortoises.

Tortricidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Tortricidae family is a large and relatively homogeneous family in the Superfamily Tortricoidea, with three subfamilies that have at times been considered separate families: Chlidanotinae, Tortricinae, and Olethreutinae. There are about 9,000 described species richly distributed worldwide in 1,000 or more genera; incalculable numbers remain unnamed in tropical regions. Many Tortricids are economically important as agricultural and forestry pests. Adults are small to moderately large (wingspan 1-3.3 cm), and are typically nocturnal with cryptically colored forewings in gray, brown, rust, or tan, occasionally with colorful markings. At rest, wings are held like a flattened roof, giving the resemblance of an arrowhead. Larvae are leaf rollers, leaf tiers, or borers in roots, stems, or fruits, and most species are specialists in food plant selection, with an enormous array of plants serving as hosts.",913
Tortricidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Tortricid moths are generally small, with a wingspan of 3 cm or less. Many species are drab and have mottled and marbled brown colors, but some diurnal species are brightly colored and mimic other moths of the families Geometridae and Pyralidae.",245

Saturniidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Saturniidae are members of the Superfamily Bombycoidea. These species are medium to very large in size, and this family includes the largest moths in North America. Adults have a wingspan of 3 to 15 centimeters, relatively small heads, and densely hairy bodies. Larvae are usually very fleshy, with clumps of raised bristles. Buck moth and Io moth caterpillars have sharp, stinging hairs. Caterpillars mostly feed on leaves of trees and shrubs; some cause severe damage. Pupa develop in silken cocoons or in the soil. This family does not contain the commercial silkworm moth (Bombyx mori), which is not native to North America.",632
Saturniidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Saturniidae, members of which are commonly named the saturniids, is a family of Lepidoptera with an estimated 2,300 described species. The family contains some of the largest species of moths in the world. Notable members include the emperor moths, royal moths, and giant silk moths (or wild silk moths).
Adults are characterized by large, lobed wings, heavy bodies covered in hair-like scales, and reduced mouthparts. They lack a frenulum, but the hindwings overlap the forewings to produce the effect of an unbroken wing surface. Saturniids are sometimes brightly colored and often have translucent eyespots or ""windows"" on their wings. Sexual dimorphism varies by species, but males can generally be distinguished by their larger, broader antennae.
Most adults have wingspans between 1–6 in (2.5–15.2 cm), but some tropical species such as the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas) may have wingspans up to 12 in (30 cm). Together with certain Noctuidae, Saturniidae contains the largest Lepidoptera and some of the largest extant insects.


== Distribution ==

The majority of saturniid species occur in wooded tropical or subtropical regions, with the greatest diversity in the New World tropics and Mexico, though they are found all over the world. About 12 described species live in Europe, one of which, the emperor moth, occurs in the British Isles, and 68 described species live in North America, 42 of which reside north of Mexico and Southern California.


== Life cycle ==

Some saturniids are strictly univoltine, producing only one generation a year, whereas others are multivoltine, producing more than one brood a year. Spring and summer broods eclose in a matter of weeks; autumn broods enter a state known as diapause and emerge the following spring. How the pupae know when to eclose early or hibernate is not yet fully understood, though research suggests day length during the fifth larval instar plays a major role, as well as cooling temperatures. Longer days may prompt pupae to develop early, while shorter days result in pupal diapause. The number of broods is flexible, and a single female may produce both fast-developing and slow-developing individuals, or they may produce different numbers of broods in different years or parts of the range. In some species, the spring and summer broods look different from each other; for example, the two Saturniinae species Actias luna (the luna moth)  and Callosamia securifera both have certain genes which may or may not be activated depending upon differences in environmental conditions.


=== Eggs ===

Depending on the moth, a single female may lay up to 200 eggs on a chosen host plant. Others are laid singly or in small groups. They are round, slightly flattened, smooth, and translucent or whitish.


=== Larvae ===

Saturniid caterpillars are large (50 to 100 mm in the final instar), stout, and cylindrical. Most have tubercules that are often also spiny or hairy. Many are cryptic in coloration, with countershading or disruptive coloration to reduce detection, but some are more colorful. Some have urticating hairs. A few species have been noted to produce clicking sounds with the larval mandibles when disturbed. Examples: luna moth (Actias luna) and Polyphemus moth (Antheraea polyphemus). The clicks may serve as aposematic warning signals to a regurgitation defense.
Most are solitary feeders, but some are gregarious. The Hemileucinae are gregarious when young and have stinging hairs, and those of Lonomia contain a poison that may kill a human. Arsenura armida is another well-known example and is infamous for its large conspicuous masses during the day. Their coloration is not cryptic, instead exhibiting aposematism.
The other caterpillars in this size range are almost universally Sphingidae, which are seldom hairy and tend to have diagonal stripes on their sides. Many Sphingidae caterpillars bear a single curved horn on their hind end. These are actually not dangerous, but large, hairy caterpillars should generally not be touched except by experts.
Most saturniid larvae feed on the foliage of trees and shrubs. A few, particularly Hemileucinae such as Automeris louisiana, A. patagonensis, and Hemileuca oliviae, feed on grasses. They moult at regular intervals, usually four to six times before entering the pupal stage. Prior to pupation, a wandering stage occurs, and the caterpillar may change color, becoming more cryptic just before this stage.


=== Pupae ===
Most larvae spin a silken cocoon in the leaves of a preferred host plant or in leaf litter on the ground, or crevices in rocks and logs. While only moderately close relatives to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) among the Lepidoptera, the cocoons of larger saturniids can be gathered and used to make silk fabric. However, larvae of some species – typically Ceratocampinae, like the regal moth (Citheronia regalis) and the imperial moth (Eacles imperialis), burrow and pupate in a small chamber beneath the soil. This is common in the Ceratocampinae and Hemileucinae. Unlike most silk moths, those that pupate underground do not use much silk in the construction. Once enclosed in the cocoon, the caterpillar sheds the larval skin and becomes a pupa, and the pupa undergoes metamorphosis for about 14 days, at which point it either emerges or goes into diapause. During metamorphosis, the respiratory system will stay intact, the digestive system will dissolve, and reproductive organs will take form.


=== Adults ===
Adult females emerge with a complete set of mature ova and ""call"" males by emitting pheromones (specific ""calling"" times vary by species). Males can detect these chemical signals up to a mile away with help from sensitive receptors located on the tips of their feather-like antennae. The males fly several miles in one night to locate a female and mate with her; females generally will not fly until after they have mated.
Since the mouthparts of adult saturniids are vestigial and digestive tracts are absent, adults subsist on stored lipids acquired during the larval stage. As such, adult behavior is devoted almost entirely to reproduction, but the end result (due to lack of feeding) is a lifespan of a week or less once emerged from the pupa.
One specific species in the family Saturniidae with a special mating pattern is Callosamia promethea (promethea silkmoth). Females will mate with multiple males and males will mate with multiple females (polygynandry). Females that mate with more than one male will produce 10% more eggs.


== Importance to humans ==

A few species are important defoliator pests, including the orange-striped oakworm moth (Anisota senatoria) on oaks, the pandora pinemoth (Coloradia pandora) on pines and Hemileuca oliviae on range grasses.
Other species are of major commercial importance in tussah and wild silk production. These notably include the Chinese tussah moth (Antheraea pernyi), its hybridogenic descendant Antheraea × proylei, and the ailanthus silkmoth (Samia cynthia). Mopane worm (Gonimbrasia belina), Gonimbrasia zambesina, the cabbage tree emperor moth (Bunaea alcinoe), Gynanisa maia, Imbrasia epimethea, Imbrasia oyemensis, Melanocera menippe, Microgone cana, Urota sinope and the pallid emperor moth (Cirina forda).
Some species of Saturniidae such as the mopane worm (Gonimbrasia belina) are used as a food source.
Most Saturniidae are harmless animals at least as adults, and in many cases at all stages of their lives. Thus, some of the more spectacular species – in particular Antheraea – can be raised by children or school classes as educational pets. The soft, silken cocoons make an interesting keepsake for pupils.
Some, including the genus Automeris, have urticating spines that sting.
Caterpillars of the genus Lonomia produce a deadly toxin injected into the victim when it is touched.


== Systematics and evolution ==
In terms of absolute numbers of species, the Saturniidae are most diverse in the Neotropics. Also, their most ancient subfamilies occur only in the Americas. Only the very ""modern"" Saturniidae are widely distributed across most parts of the world. Thus, it is quite safe to assume – even in the absence of a comprehensive fossil record – that the first Saturniidae originated in the Neotropical region. Note that at least two of the subfamilies included below are commonly treated as separate families (Oxyteninae and Cercophaninae).
The following list arranges the subfamilies in the presumed phylogenetic sequence, from the most ancient to the most advanced.

Subfamily Oxyteninae (3 genera, 35 species)
Subfamily Cercophaninae (4 genera, 10 species)
Subfamily Arsenurinae (10 genera, 60 species, Neotropics)
Subfamily Ceratocampinae (27 genera, 170 species, Americas)
Subfamily Hemileucinae (51 genera, 630 species, Americas)
Subfamily Agliinae (1 genus, 3 species)
Subfamily Ludiinae (disputed) (8 genera, Africa)
Subfamily Salassinae (1 genus, 12 species, tropics)
Subfamily Saturniinae (59 genera, 480 species, tropical and temperate regions worldwide)

Sematuridae,family,wikipedia.org,"Sematuridae is a family of moths in the lepidopteran order that contains two subfamilies (Minet and Scoble, 1999).


== Taxonomy, systematics, and identification ==
These are large day- or night-flying moths, usually tailed and similar to Uraniidae in general appearance [1] (except for the genera Apoprogones, Anuropteryx and Lonchotura). The position of this family is not certain amongst the Macrolepidoptera but it is usually considered to belong to the superfamily Geometroidea, whilst the identity of its closest extant relative is under investigation using DNA sequencing[2]. Until recently very little has been known of sematurid biology (but see Sematurinae).  The ""chaetosemata"" of Sematuridae have long setae overhanging the compound eyes, the antennae are thickened towards the often rather clubbed or hooked tip whilst a tympanal organ for hearing is always absent and there are other diagnostic characters in the abdomen (Minet and Scoble, 1999: 305-307; Holloway et al., 2001).


== Distribution ==
Apoprogoninae is represented by a single species in South Africa whilst Sematurinae is represented by about 29 (41 including the genera Anurapteryx and Lonchotura) species in the Neotropics. Such an apparently relictual distribution might relate to the geological split of South America and Africa, but there is as yet no evidence for the age of evolutionary divergence of Neotropical and Afrotropical representatives; moreover, new genetic material would be needed for the South African taxon as well as the American genera Anurapteryx and Lonchotura for a modern molecular approach to this problem to succeed [3].

Uraniidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Uraniidae are a family of moths containing four subfamilies, 90 genera, and roughly 700 species.  The family is distributed throughout the tropics of the Americas, Africa and Indo-Australia.  Some of the tropical species are known for their bright, butterfly-like colors and are called sunset moths (for example Chrysiridia rhipheus).  Such moths are apparently toxic and the bright colors are a warning to predators.
The family Uraniidae contains both diurnal and nocturnal species.  The day-flying species are usually more strikingly colored and vibrant than the nocturnal ones.  Many diurnal species also have iridescent scales and multiple tails, which often led them to be mistaken for butterflies.  In sharp contrast, the nocturnal species are generally small, pale-colored insects.  The Uraniidae are similar to the geometer moths, to which they are related, but a different wing veining pattern distinguishes them.

About 1,000 species are described worldwide, and the family is relatively well studied owing to the fascinating, colorful forms, diurnal habits, and mimicry associated with the chemical ecology. All New World species are in the subfamily Procridinae. These diurnal moths are avoided by birds and other predators because both adults and larvae are able to release hydrocyanic acid (HCN), which has enabled many to take part in complex mimicry relationships. Adults are variable in size, and have a well-developed proboscis and commonly visit flowers. Wings are highly variable in shape and are often metallic colored. Eggs are deposited in rows, clusters, or overlapping patches and sometimes covered with scales. Larvae are stout and broad, and feed on numerous angiosperm plant families, probably mostly host specific.",878
Zygaenidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Zygaenidae moths are a family of Lepidoptera. The majority of zygaenids are tropical, but they are nevertheless quite well represented in temperate regions. Some of the 1000 or so species are commonly known as burnet or forester moths, often qualified by the number of spots, although other families also have 'foresters'. They are also sometimes called smoky moths.
All 43 species of Australian zygaenids are commonly known as foresters and belong to the tribe Artonini. The only nonendemic species in Australia is Palmartona catoxantha, a Southeast Asian pest species which is believed to be already present in Australia or likely to arrive soon.


== Description ==


=== Larvae ===
Larvae are stout and may be flattened. A fleshy extension of the thorax covers the head. Most feed on herbaceous plants, but some are tree feeders. Larvae in two subfamilies, Chalcosiinae and Zygaeninae, have cavities in which they store the cyanide, and can excrete it as defensive droplets.


=== Aposematism in adults ===
Zygaenid moths are typically day flying with a slow, fluttering flight, and with rather clubbed antennae. They generally have a metallic sheen and often prominent spots of red or yellow. 
The bright colours are a warning to predators that the moths are distasteful - they contain hydrogen cyanide (HCN) throughout all stages of their life cycle. Unlike most insects with such toxins, they obtain glucosides from the plants they utilize so that HCN can be used as a defence. However, they are capable of making HCN themselves, and when in an environment poor in cyanide-producing plants, synthesize it themselves. They form mimicry complexes based on these toxins.
However, while the overall picture is of genuine aposematism – the insects are both conspicuously coloured and toxic, containing cyanogenic glucosides – a study by Emmanuelle Briolat and colleagues including Martin Stevens found no evidence of a quantitative relationship between the visual signals of different species of Zygaenidae and their toxicity.


== Evolution ==
The fossil species Neurosymploca? oligocenica, belonging to the subfamily Zygaeninae, is known from Lower Stampian (Early Oligocene) deposits in Céreste, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. Lepidopterans with preserved structural coloration from the Eocene (~47 Ma) shales of the Messel Pit, Germany, are suggested to be zygaenids, and more specifically procridines due to wing venation patterns.

Zygaenidae,family,artfakta.se,"Bastardsvärmarna är en grupp fjärilar med iögonfallande färg och teckning. Alla arter i familjen har enbart dagaktiva fjärilar med förhållandevis kraftig kropp och smala vingar. Trots att de flyger på dagen tillhör de inte den grupp fjärilar som normalt kallas dagfjärilar. De har liksom de äkta dagfjärilarna (Papilionoidea) klubblika antenner, vilket saknas hos övriga fjärilar. Vid vila fäller de samman vingarna takformigt över ryggen till skillnad från dagfjärilarna som fäller ihop sina vingar vertikalt över kroppen.

An ermine moth is any moth in the family Yponomeutidae, which has several hundred species, most of them in the tropics. The larvae tend to form communal webs, and some are minor pests in agriculture, forestry, and horticulture. Adult moths are minor pollinators.


== Taxonomy ==
The traditional morphology based taxonomy of Kyrki (1990) divided Yponomeutidae into six subfamilies, but this circumscription is not found to be monophyletic in molecular phylogenetic analyses.  van Nieukerken et al (2011) split off Praydidae, Attevidae and Argyresthiidae as separate families, and Sohn (2013) elevated Scythropiinae to family to contain Scythropia.
The two remaining subfamilies are:

Saridoscelinae
Yponomeutinae
The following genera have not been assigned subfamilies:


== Characteristics ==

Ermine moths are small to medium-sized moths varying in wingspan from 8 to 31 mm (0.3 to 1.2 in). The heads mostly have smooth scales, the haustellum is naked and the labial palps are curved upwards. The maxillary palps usually consist of one or two segments. The wings are long, often with fringes on the trailing edges of the hindwings. The colour is usually white, pale grey or drab, often with many dark speckles.
Adult ermine moths are mostly nocturnal.
The larvae are leaf-webbers, leaf skeletonizers, leafminers or needleminers and are found on a variety of host plants. Some cause economic damage to crops and trees.


== Species (selection) ==
Better-known species include:

Spindle ermine, Yponomeuta cagnagella

Orchard ermine, Yponomeuta padella
Yponomeuta plumbella
Acmosara polyxena
Apple ermine Yponomeuta malinellus
Ailanthus webworm


== Etymology ==
The word Yponomeutidae comes from the Ancient Greek ὑπό (ypo) meaning under and νομός (nomós) meaning food or dwelling, thus ""feeding secretly, or burrow"".

Urodidae were previously included in the superfamily Yponomeutoidea (Kyrki, 1984, 1988) and have also been lumped with Galacticidae (Heppner, 1991, 1997) or with other Sesioidea (Heppner, 1998). They belong to the lower part of the lepidopteran clade ""Apoditrysia"" (Dugdale et al., 1999) (i.e. not ""Obtectomera""[1]), but their closest relatives are as yet unknown and it is hoped that DNA sequencing can help resolve this question.
Urodidae was formerly the only family in the superfamily Urodoidea, but in 2020 a new family was described within Urodoidea, Ustyurtiidae.


== Morphology and identification ==
Urodidae resemble some Zygaenidae: Procridinae at rest. These small to medium-sized moths measure 11 to 37 mm in wingspan and often have a greyish or mottled forewing background colour. The male adult has a ""hairpencil"" on the costa of the hindwing. In the caterpillar, the placement of the setae and structure of the prolegs is diagnostic, and the pupal segments I–II are fixed. On the head, there are no ocelli or ""chaetosemata"" and the proboscis even at the base is unscaled. An ""epiphysis"" is present on the foreleg (Dugdale et al. (1999), and for more details).


== Distribution ==
The genera Urodus and Spiladarcha occur in the Neotropics while Wockia asperipunctella occurs in Europe and has recently been found in northern North America (Heppner, 1997; Landry, 1998) and unless this is a recent invasion the species would be a good example of a Holarctic distribution pattern.


== Biology and host plants ==

The biology is poorly known, but the larvae can be found on various tree species including some fruit trees. The ""bumelia webworm moth"" (Urodus parvula) is recorded on Lauraceae: (avocado=Persea), Fagaceae (Quercus), Sapotaceae (Sideroxylon) and Erythroxylaceae: Erythroxylum. Urodus parvula has also been reared on Rutaceae (Citrus) and Malvaceae (Hibiscus). W. asperipunctella has in North America been reared from quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) (Landry, 1998) and also Salix in Europe. The pupa is contained in an open-mesh cocoon, which can be bright orange in colour, and is sometimes suspended on a very long thread below a leaf.

Notodontidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Notodontidae are members of the Superfamily Noctuoidea. These medium-sized moths have stout bodies and are typically drab--brown or grayish in color. Female prominents are generally larger than males. The proboscis varies widely; it is specialized in some species and reduced in others. When resting, prominents either hold their wings like a roof over the body or roll them, causing the moth to look like a stick. Larvae of some species are oddly shaped and look like parts of the host plant. Others are brightly colored and striped. Some are serious forest pests. Most prominents overwinter as larvae, pupating in a cell in the soil or in a loose cocoon on the ground in the spring.",688
Notodontidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Notodontidae is a family of moths with approximately 3,800 known species. The family was described by James Francis Stephens in 1829. Moths of this family are found in all parts of the world, but they are most concentrated in tropical areas, especially in the New World (Miller, 1992).
Species of this family tend to be heavy-bodied and long-winged, the wings held folded across the back of the body at rest. They rarely display any bright colours, usually being mainly grey or brown, with the exception of the subfamily Dioptinae (Grimaldi and Engel, 2005). These features mean they rather resemble Noctuidae although the families are not closely related. The adults do not feed. Many species have a tuft of hair on the trailing edge of the forewing which protrudes upwards at rest. This gives them their scientific name ""back tooth"" and the common name of prominents. The common names of some other species reflect their hairiness, such as puss moth and the group commonly known as kittens (Furcula spp.), so named as they resemble small versions of the puss moth.


== Life cycle ==


=== Egg ===
The egg is hemispherical or almost spherical, and lacks any ribs (Scoble, 1995).


=== Larvae ===
The caterpillars are usually hairless, but may have tubercules, spines, or humps (Scoble 1995), and often rest with both ends raised. The last set of prolegs is frequently vestigial, or may be long, with glands that can be everted. Some larvae undergo shape modification and colour changes with each instar (Weller, 1992). Notodontid larvae are notable for their often bizarre shapes, and some have chemical defences (cyanic acid, formic acid, and other ketones: Blum, 1981) not commonly found in other Lepidoptera (Weller 1992). Schizura unicornis and S. badia have a mixture of formic acid, acetic acid and other compounds which they spray accurately at their attacker (Attygalle et al., 1993).

The larvae of some species are truly extraordinary: That of the puss moth has a fearsome-looking ""face"" and two long whip-like ""tails"" (actually highly modified prolegs) and it rears both ends in a threatening display when disturbed. The larva of the lobster moth is even more remarkable, resembling a crustacean. Others, such as Cerura vinula
mimic the edge of a leaf that has been damaged and is turning brown (they rest and feed along the edge of the leaf).
Most are solitary feeders, but some are gregarious, and this is most common in the processionary moths, Thaumetopoeinae.
They feed on trees and shrubs, except in the subfamily Dioptinae, which feed on herbaceous plants (Miller, 1992). The larvae typically feed on only one family of trees, but closely related species will feed on distantly related plants; for example different members of the genus Datana feed on Juglandaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Ericaceae and Anacardiaceae (Miller 1992).


=== Adults ===
Adults have tympanal organs on the metathorax that opens towards the top, and the tibial spurs have serrated edges (Scoble, 1995). Mouthparts vary from well-developed to absent. The Dioptinae, which was formerly considered a separate family, are colourful and fly by day, while the rest of the notodontids are nocturnal. Some of these Dioptinae have non-functional tympanal hearing organs which are normally defensive against bats (Fullard et al., 1997).


== Importance ==
Some notodontids cause noticeable defoliation of their hosts. Well-known defoliators include: the saddled prominent (Heterocampa guttivita), poplar defoliator (Clostera cupreata), California oakworm (Phryganidia californica), the beech caterpillar, (Quadricalcarifera punctatella), variable oakleaf caterpillar (Lochmaeus manteo), Epicerura pergisea, yellownecked caterpillars (Datana ministra), and walnut caterpillar (Datana integerrima), among others.


== Systematics ==
Formerly, the genus Oenosandra was placed in this family and the subfamily Thaumetopoeinae was treated at independent family rank, however they have now been reclassified. Recent molecular research has stabilized and consolidated most of the constituent subfamily and tribal rank taxa.


== Notable species ==
Buff-tip (Phalera bucephala)
Puss moth (Cerura vinula)
Lobster moth (Stauropus fagi)
Poplar kitten (Furcula bifida)
Coxcomb prominent (Ptilodon capucina)
Rough prominent (Nadata gibbosa)

== Taxonomy ==
The family was recently severely restricted, and currently contains only one or two subfamilies, the Bombycinae and Epiinae (previously the tribe Epiini). The former subfamilies Oberthueriinae and Prismostictinae have been placed as subjective junior synonyms of Endromidae. The former subfamilies Apatelodinae and Phiditiinae have been reinstated as separate families.


== Genera ==
This list is provisional. Epia may also be placed within Apatelodidae, along with Tamphana. Some genera were formerly placed in Apatelodinae, such as Anticla and Quentalia.

Pyralidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Pyralidae are members of the Superfamily Pyraloidea. A diverse group, there are more than 6,000 species described worldwide, and more than 600 species in America north of Mexico, comprising the third largest moth family in North America. These are small to medium and occasionally large moths (wingspan 0.9-3.7 cm) with variable morphological features. Adults hold their wings out to the side, fold them flat, or roll them up, making their bodies look like sticks. Larvae are primarily concealed feeders, most often borers in seeds, fruit, or stems, or in tunnels in the soil beneath plants. Others construct nestlike shelters among tied leaves, sometimes of tough silk. Diverse living plants are consumed, as well as dry vegetable matter including seeds, <i>Hymenoptera</i> nests, and wax in bee hives. Many are household and granary pests that have been transported worldwide by human activities.",902
Pyralidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Pyralidae, commonly called pyralid moths, snout moths or grass moths, are a family of Lepidoptera in the ditrysian superfamily Pyraloidea. In many (particularly older) classifications, the grass moths (Crambidae) are included in the Pyralidae as a subfamily, making the combined group one of the largest families in the Lepidoptera. The latest review by Eugene G. Munroe and Maria Alma Solis retain the Crambidae as a full family of Pyraloidea.
The wingspans for small and medium-sized species are usually between 9 and 37 mm (0.35 and 1.46 in) with variable morphological features.
It is a diverse group, with more than 6,000 species described worldwide, and more than 600 species in America north of Mexico, comprising the third largest moth family in North America. At least 42 species have been recorded from North Dakota in the subfamilies of Pyralidae.


== Relationship with humans ==
Most of these small moths are inconspicuous. Many are economically important pests, including waxworms, which are the caterpillar larvae of the greater (Galleria mellonella) and lesser (Achroia grisella) wax moths (subfamily Galleriinae). They are natively pests of beehives, but are bred indoors in enormous numbers as live food for small reptile and bird pets and similar animals. They are also used as fishing bait for trout fishing.
Other notable snout moth pests relevant for their larval hosts include:

Alligatorweed stem borer (Arcola malloi: Phycitinae) – biological control of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides).
Almond moth (Cadra cautella: Phycitinae) – pest of stored cereals and dry fruit; now introduced almost worldwide.
Cacao moth, tobacco moth, warehouse moth (Ephestia elutella: Phycitinae) – pest of stored dry vegetable products; Europe, introduced to some other regions (e.g. Australia).
Dried fruit moth (Cadra calidella: Phycitinae)
Etiella behrii (Phycitinae) – pest of stored legumes; Southeast Asia and Australia
""Flour moths"" – pests of stored grains, spices, flour, and similar dry vegetable products; now introduced almost worldwide.
Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella: Phycitinae)
Mediterranean flour moth, Indian flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella: Phycitinae)
Grease moth (Aglossa pinguinalis: Pyralinae) – pest of suet and other oily food.
Lesser cornstalk borer (Elasmopalpus lignosellus: Phycitinae) – stalk pest of corn (Zea mays); tropical and subtropical Americas, introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.
Locust bean moth (Ectomyelois ceratoniae: Phycitinae)
Mahogany webworm (Macalla thyrsisalis: Epipaschiinae) – defoliator pest of mahogany trees (Swietenia); Neotropics.
Meal moth (Pyralis farinalis: Pyralinae) – pest of stored grain, flour and other cereals; now introduced almost worldwide.
Pear fruit borer (Pempelia heringii: Phycitinae) – pest of apple and pear fruits; East Asia, introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.
Pine webworm (Pococera robustella: Epipaschiinae) – defoliator pest of pines (Pinus); North America east of Great Lakes region.
Raisin moth (Cadra figulilella: Phycitinae) – pests of stored dry fruit; now introduced almost worldwide.
Rice moth (Corcyra cephalonica: Galleriinae) – pest of stored grain, flour and other cereals.
South American cactus moth (Cactoblastis cactorum: Phycitinae) – biological control of prickly pears (Opuntia).
Southern pine coneworm, ""pitch moth"" (Dioryctria amatella: Phycitinae) – cone and shoot pest of pines (Pinus); southern North America.
Stored nut moth (Paralipsa gularis: Galleriinae) – pest of stored nuts and drupes; Southeast Asia, introduced to Western Europe.
Sunflower moth (Homoeosoma nebulella: Phycitinae) – pest of sunflower seeds; Europe and surrounding regions.
The European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and southern cornstalk borer (Diatraea crambidoides), formerly considered snout moths, are placed in the Crambidae which, as noted above, are usually regarded as a separate family today.


== Systematics ==

Five subfamilies are generally recognized in the Pyralidae today. The Acentropinae (= Nymphulinae), occasionally still placed here, do indeed seem to belong in the Crambidae.
The snout moth subfamilies are, listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence from the most primitive to the most advanced:

Chrysauginae (including Bradypodicolinae, Semniidae) – about 400 species occurring predominantly in the Neotropical region. Larvae typically feed on plants, but some have more unusual feeding habits. The latter include for example some myrmecophilous species, as well as a number of sloth moths which are dependent on sloths for their entire life cycle. Most Chrysauginae larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the metathorax.
Galleriinae (including Macrothecinae) – about 300 species worldwide. The males of galleriine moths have a gnathos almost or completely reduced, the pupae have a prominent dorsal median ridge on the thorax and abdomen, and most larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the first abdominal segment.
Pyralinae (including Endotrichinae, Hypotiinae) – rather diverse in the Old World; a lesser number of the roughly 900 species occurs elsewhere. The females of almost all Pyralinae except Cardamyla and Embryoglossa are recognizable by the very short ductus bursae of their genitals.
Epipaschiinae (including Pococerinae) – over 550 described species in the tropical and temperate regions (except Europe). Larvae are leaf rollers, leaf tiers, or leaf miners. Some species are minor pests of a few commercial crops. Epipaschiinae are generally hard to recognize, except in the case of adult males which have a few characteristic traits, such as the upturned and pointed third segment of the labial palps and usually a scaly projection from the antenna base. The larvae lack any stereotyped seta sclerotisations.
Phycitinae (including Anerastiinae, Peoriinae) – probably the most difficult group of Pyraloidea in terms of identification and classification. They comprise more than 600 genera and about 4000 species found all over the world. The characteristic trait of the caterpillars is a sclerotised area encircling the base of seta SD1 on the mesothorax, while the adult females have – like the males of Pyralidae in general do – a frenulum consisting of a single bristle which in turn is composed of multiple acanthae.


=== Problematic genera ===
In addition to those assigned to the tribes above, several genera of (presumed) Pyralidae are not firmly placed in this arrangement, but are incertae sedis. Some may be very basal lineages which stand outside the main snout moth radiations, but given the changing circumscription of the Pyralidae, some are likely to be placed outside this group in its modern meaning, either in the Crambidae or in other lineages of basal Obtectomera. Some may even belong to more ancient moth lineages, such as the Alucitoidea or Pterophoroidea. Finally, some of these (usually little-studied) genera possibly are junior synonyms of genera described earlier. These genera are in the unranked category of the family Pyralidae.
The genera in question are:

These genera have been placed in the Pyralidae when these were still circumscribed sensu lato and are sometimes still treated thus, but actually they seem to belong in the Crambidae (see also Micronix and Tanaobela):

Pterophoridae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Pterophoridae are part of the Superfamily Pterophoroidea. More than 1,000 species have been described worldwide, with probably many undescribed tropical species. In America north of Mexico, more than 150 species have been named, and these are found primarily in the West. Adults are medium to small (wingspan 1.3-4.1 cm), with long and slender bodies, legs, and wings, and a T-shaped appearance when at rest. They typically have deeply cleft wings, with each of the three divisions of the hindwings bearing broad fringes, from which the family common name derives. These moths are usually nocturnal and dull colored, tan, brown, or gray with paler and darker markings. Some species are borers in stems or roots, but most are external feeders on foliage. Pupae are either formed in larval galleries or affixed to host-plant stems or debris, fully exposed, and feed on living angiosperm plants.",896
Pterophoridae,family,wikipedia.org,"The forewings of plume moths usually consist of two curved spars with more or less bedraggled bristles trailing behind. This resembles the closely related Alucitidae (many-plumed moths) at first glance, but the latter have a greater number of symmetrical plumes. The hindwings are similarly constructed, but have three spars. This unorthodox structure does not prevent flight. A few genera have normal lepidopteran wings.
The usual resting posture is with the wings extended laterally and narrowly rolled up. Often they resemble a piece of dried grass, and may pass unnoticed by potential predators even when resting in exposed situations in daylight. Some species have larvae which are stem- or root-borers while others are leaf-browsers.

Economically important pterophorids include the artichoke plume moth (Platyptilia carduidactyla), an artichoke (Cynara cardunculus) pest in California, while the geranium plume moth (Platyptilia pica) and the snapdragon plume moth (Stenoptilodes antirrhina) can cause damage to the ornamental plants garden geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum) and common snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), respectively. Other plume moths have been used as biological control agents against invasive plant species – Lantanophaga pusillidactyla against West Indian lantana (Lantana camara), Oidaematophorus beneficus against mistflower (Ageratina riparia), Hellinsia balanotes against groundsel bush (Baccharis halimifolia), and Wheeleria spilodactylus against horehound (Marrubium vulgare).",1508

Psychidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Psychidae are a group of small to medium-sized moths that are members of the Superfamily Tineiodea. Female adults of most species lack wings or have very small and non-functional wings. Males are typically black and their wingspan is 1.2-3.6 cm. The abdomen of these moths is long and tapering. Adults of both sexes have vestigal mouth parts. In some species, females entirely lack eyes, antennae, and legs. Larvae form characteristic spindle-shaped silken cases covered with bits of leaves, twigs, and other debris. Each larva enlarges its case as it grows. These moths pupate in the larval case after it is attached to a twig with silk. In most species, the female does not leave the case, but attracts males by emitting pheromones from her abdomen. To mate, the male thrusts his abdomen through the open lower end of the case. The female lays her eggs in the case; when they hatch, larvae crawl away to feed and form their own silken cases.",947
Psychidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The caterpillar larvae of Psychidae construct cases out of silk and environmental materials such as sand, soil, lichen, or plant materials. These cases are attached to rocks, trees or fences while resting or during their pupa stage, but are otherwise mobile. The larvae of some species eat lichen, while others prefer green leaves. In many species, the adult females lack wings and are therefore difficult to identify accurately. Case-bearer cases are usually much smaller, flimsier, and consist mainly of silk, while bagworm ""bags"" resemble caddisfly cases in their outward appearance – a mass of (mainly) plant detritus spun together with silk on the inside.
Bagworm cases range in size from less than 1 cm to 15 cm among some tropical species. Each species makes a case particular to its species, making the case more useful to identify the species than the creature itself. Cases among the more primitive species are flat. More specialized species exhibit a greater variety of case size, shape, and composition, usually narrowing on both ends. The attachment substance used to affix the bag to host plant, or structure, can be very strong, sometimes requiring a great deal of force to remove. Body markings are rare. Adult females of many bagworm species are larviform, with only vestigial wings, legs, and mouthparts. In some species, parthenogenesis is known. The adult males of most species are strong fliers with well-developed wings and feathery antennae but survive only long enough to reproduce due to underdeveloped mouthparts that prevent them from feeding. Most male bagworm wings have few of the scales characteristic of most moths, instead having a thin covering of hairs.",1688
Psychidae,family,artfakta.se,"Det finns ungefär 1000 kända arter av säckspinnare, varav de flesta har palearktisk utbredning. Bland säckspinnarna är det närmast ett undantag att båda könen har fullt utvecklade vingar. Hanarna har alltid vingar, men honor hos de flesta arter är vinglösa. Hos vissa arter saknas hanar helt och fortplantningen sker partenogenetiskt (utan befruktning). Många säckspinnare är mycket svåra att skilja från varandra. Förkomsten av helt eller delvis partenogenetiska arter/former där honorna nästan helt saknar särskiljande yttre drag gör avgränsningen av arter svåra. I vissa grupper råder därför tvekan om vad som utgör självständiga arter och vad som är partenogenetiska former av i övrigt sexuellt reproducerande arter.

Plutellidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Plutellid moths are part of the Superfamily Yponomeutoidea. About 22 species are known in North America, all of which occur in the West. Typical members of this family are smaller and relatively slender compared to <i>Ypsolopha</i> (wingspan 1.2-1.5 cm), and most feed on plants in the Brassicaceae family (mustards and cabbages). Pupation occurs in a loose, meshwork cocoons.",380
Plutellidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Plutellidae are a family of moths commonly known as the diamondback moths, named after the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) of European origin. It was once considered to have three subfamilies: Plutellinae, Praydinae, and Scythropiinae. Praydinae was later elevated to its own family, Praydidae, while Scythropiinae has variously been moved to Yponomeutidae or also elevated to its own family.


== Characteristics ==
Moths in this family are small to medium in size with wingspans ranging from 7 to 55 mm (0.3 to 2.2 in). The head usually bears smooth scales and the antennae are often thickened in the middle. The wings are elongated and the hindwings often bear long fringes. The forewings often appear to be sickle-shaped because of the arrangement of the fringes. The colouring is generally drab, with various banding and marking. The adults are mostly nocturnal or crepuscular. The larvae feed on the surfaces of leaves which they skeletonise. The host plants vary, but many are in the family Brassicaceae. Some species are economic pests, especially Plutella xylostella.


== Genera ==
Below are the genera of the family Plutellidae:


== Excluded genera and species ==
The fungus moth Erechthias niphochrysa was also once included here, as a distinct genus Acrocenotes.
The family Acrolepiidae (including the genera Acrolepia, Acrolepiopsis, and Digitivalva) is sometimes included in the Plutellidae.

Oecophoridae,family,wikipedia.org,"Oecophoridae (concealer moths) is a family of small moths in the superfamily Gelechioidea. The phylogeny and systematics of gelechoid moths are still not fully resolved, and the circumscription of the Oecophoridae is strongly affected by this.

Pleurotinae Toll, 1956
Deuterogoniinae Spuler, 1910
Unplaced
Colchia Lvovsky, 1995
Also possibly included is the Peruvian species Auxotricha ochrogypsa, described by Edward Meyrick in 1931 as the sole member of its genus. In the past, the family was circumscribed more widely and included the following subfamilies:

Amphisbatinae (sometimes in Depressariinae)
Autostichinae
Depressariinae (including Cryptolechiinae)
Hypertrophinae
Metachandinae
Oecophorinae (including Chimabachinae, Deuterogoniinae, Peleopodinae, Philobotinae)
Stathmopodinae
Stenomatinae

Some treatments include only the Oecophorinae and Stathmopodinae here, placing the others elsewhere in the Gelechoidea (typically in the Elachistidae, but occasionally as independent families). But this approach might make Elachistidae highly paraphyletic. Other authors go as far as to expand the Oecophoridae beyond the delimitation used here, including also such groups as the Ethmiidae and Xyloryctidae. The latter may indeed be part of a monophyletic Oecophoridae, but more research is required; the Ethmiidae on the other hand are more likely a distinct family. The mysterious genus Aeolanthes is also sometimes included in the Oecophoridae (as a monotypic subfamily Aeolanthinae), but its actual relationships are quite obscure.
Some additional genera are also treated as Oecophoridae incertae sedis in recent studies:

Amseloecia Povolný, 1983
Callimodes Leraut, 1989 (Oecophorinae?)
subgenus Orienta Lvovsky, 1995
Colchia Lvovsky, 1995

†Epiborkhausenites Skalski, 1973 (Bartonian age, Baltic amber, Lithuania)


== Relationship with humans ==
Many concealer moths feed on dead plant material and are nutrient recyclers. On the other hand, the family includes the white-shouldered house moth (Endrosis sarcitrella), which is a widely distributed moth that has caterpillars that infest stored grain, and the brown house moth (Hofmannophila pseudospretella), which feeds on textiles and carpets as well as stored foodstuffs.
Concealer moths have also been put to useful service. Agonopterix ulicetella, a native of Europe, has been introduced to New Zealand and Hawaii in an attempt to control the European gorse (Ulex europaeus), and the defoliating hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) has been used against Conium maculatum poison hemlock in the United States.

These are medium-sized to very large moths, usually with drab, cryptically marked forewings and brightly coloured hindwings. They have clubbed antennae and are day flying, and are often mistaken for butterflies. Indeed, some previous classification systems placed this family within the butterflies or skippers. The Neotropical species are commonly known as giant butterfly-moths, the Australian and Asian species as sun moths. The larvae are internal feeders, often on roots of epiphytes or on monocotyledons.

Cossidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Cossidae are members of the Superfamily Cossoidea. They occur worldwide, with more than 670 described species. The greatest numbers are found in tropical regions. About 50 species in America north of Mexico, 75% of which are found on the western side of the continent. These moths are small to large and hawk moth-like, and are the largest of the ""microlepidoptera,"" with wingspans from 2.5 to 8.5 cm. They are also referred to as ""goat moths,"" ""carpenterworms,"" or ""leopard moths"". Adults are robust and heavy-bodied, and are typically nocturnal, drab, and mostly gray with black markings. Females are often much larger than males. Eggs are usually laid in crevices or under bark with an extensible ovipositor, and may be produced in vast numbers. Larvae bore into branches or trunks of living shrubs or trees, sometimes causing considerable damage, and require 1 to 4 years to mature. Host plants include at least 17 families of angiosperms.",947
Cossidae,family,wikipedia.org,"This family includes many species with large caterpillars and moths with a wingspan from 9–24 cm (3+1⁄2–9+1⁄2 in). These moths are mostly grey; some have long, narrow wings and resemble hawkmoths (Sphingidae) which are more advanced macrolepidoptera, however. Many are twig, bark, or leaf mimics, and Cossidae often have some sort of large marking at the tip of the forewing uppersides, conspicuous in flight, but resembling a broken-off twig when the animals are resting.
Caterpillars are smooth with a few hairs. Most cossid caterpillars are tree borers, in some species taking up to three years to mature. The caterpillars pupate within their tunnels; they often have an unpleasant smell, hence another colloquial name is goat moths.
The family includes the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae) and the goat moth (Cossus cossus) which have gained popularity as pests. However, the large caterpillars of species that do not smell badly are often edible. Witchetty grubs – among the Outback's most famous bush tucker – are most commonly the caterpillars of Endoxyla leucomochla, one of the more than 80 cossid species in Australia. In Chile, the sweet-smelling caterpillars of the Chilean moth (Chilecomadia moorei) are harvested in quantity and internationally traded as butterworms, for use as pet food and fishing bait.",1324

Blastobasidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Blastobasidae are members of the Superfamily Gelechioidea. Blastobasids occur worldwide, but are most diverse in North and South America, with more than 275 described species and possibly five to 10 times that many yet to be studied. Blastobasids are small, nocturnal moths with narrow wings. Most species are uniformly dull colored, usually gray, sometimes tan or yellowish.  Larvae are typically slender and cylindrical, and many species feed on detritus associated with the nests and galleries of other insect species.",525
Blastobasidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The adults are generally small, slender moths which at a casual glance lack conspicuous and characteristic features – noted entomologist Edward Meyrick once described the group as ""obscure and dull-coloured moths, decidedly the least attractive family of Lepidoptera"". Their coloration is usually reddish-brown, without crisp streaks or large wingspots.
The head is smooth, with moderately long antennae (slightly more than half as long as the forewings) which are each situated halfway down the head. As usual for moths, the antennae do not have clubs; even in the males they are smooth or almost so and not at all comb-like. The antenna base bears a small brush of dense hairs and is flat, with a concave underside and may cover part of the compound eyes. The Blastobasidae have few or no bristles on the compound eyes, no ocelli, and probably lack chaetosemata too. The mouthparts are well-developed and moderately specialized, with 4-segmented folding maxillary palps, long labial palps and a long proboscis with a scaly base. The tibiae of the forelegs are enlarged at the end, those of the middle legs two spurs, and those of the hindlegs 4 spurs and many long thin hairs.
Wingspan in this family is about 12 to 24 mm, more than 10 times as much as the thorax width. The forewings lack a tornus and are about 4-5 times as long as they are wide, with a convex outer margin and a rather blunt tip. The round-tipped hindwings are very narrow, of equal or somewhat less length as the forewings, to which they are joined with a frenulum. The edge of the hindwings is surrounded by a fringe of hairs about two times as long as the wing is wide.
The wing venation of forewings and hindwings differs. The forewing has 12 veins altogether, with two anal veins – vein 1b and 1c, the former of which forks proximally – and a distally complete tubular vein (1c). The transverse vein is complete, and the discal cell has no tubular vein running through its middle. By contrast, the hindwings have seven or eight veins. Their anal veins are 1b and 1c like on the forewings; they lack vein 1a but also have the tubular vein 1c. Vein 1b may fork as in the forewings or remain unbranched, while a transverse vein may be present or not. Usually, five veins arise from the hindwing cell, of which the fourth and fifth are proximally joined; Blastobasis, however, might only have four cell veins, with veins 3 and 5 joined and vein 4 missing, but this is not universally accepted. Hindwing vein 8 either runs along the upper cell margin initially and anastomoses with it, or possibly it arises from the cell margin in some species, but in neither case does it run close to vein 7.
The caterpillars (larvae) have 10 prolegs and feed openly, usually on dead organic matter. Some species are pests of stored foodstuffs. The pupae are concealed and are not protruded during hatching.",2865

Crambidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Crambidae belong to the Superfamily Pyraloidea. More than 11,500 species have been described worldwide, with more than 800 species in America north of Mexico, the majority of which occur in the Atlantic and southeastern states, or southern Texas and Arizona. Crambids are diverse and variable in morphology and biology. Habits and morphology of larvae are also highly variable among subfamilies, and include agricultural pest species.",438
Crambidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Crambidae comprises the grass moth family of lepidopterans. They are variable in appearance, with the nominal subfamily Crambinae (grass moths) taking up closely folded postures on grass stems where they are inconspicuous, while other subfamilies include brightly coloured and patterned insects that rest in wing-spread attitudes.
In many classifications, the Crambidae have been treated as a subfamily of the Pyralidae or snout moths. The principal difference is a structure in the tympanal organs called the praecinctorium, which joins two tympanic membranes in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae. The latest review by Munroe and Solis, in Kristensen (1999), retains the Crambidae as a full family. The family currently comprises 15 subfamilies with altogether 10,347 species in over 1,000 genera.

== Relationship with humans ==
Since crambids are relatively common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), used to control its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil, and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption. The mint moth (Pyrausta aurata) is an example of a harmless crambid.
Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the pearl millet stem borer (Coniesta ignefusalis), the spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), sod webworms (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape leaffolder (Desmia maculalis).

== Taxonomical placement ==
Doidae was elevated to family rank by Julian P. Donahue and John W. Brown in 1987. They have a complex taxonomical history, and have previously been placed in Geometridae, Arctiidae, Lymantriidae and Dioptidae among several other families. As a family, Doidae was formerly included in superfamily Noctuoidea, but was transferred to the Drepanoidea in 2011 by van Nieukerken et al.


== Genera and species ==
As of May 2024, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility lists seven species in two genera for Doidae:

Genus Doa Neumoegen & Dyar, 1894 - type genus
Doa ampla (Grote, 1878) - South-western US, Mexico
Doa cubana Schaus, 1906 - Cuba

Epermeniidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The family Epermeniidae has about 100 described species distributed worldwide, with 11 species documented in western North America, and is part of the Superfamily Epermenioidea. Adults are small (wingspan of 0.9-1.8 cm), sluggish, diurnal moths, yellowish to grayish in color and are not seen often in the field. Caterpillars are sluggish and usually mine in leaves, preferring plants in the parsley family. Pupation occurs under a sparse, loose net cocoon.",457
Epermeniidae,family,wikipedia.org,"Epermeniidae or the fringe-tufted moths is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order with about 14 genera. Previously they have been divided in two subfamilies Epermeniinae and Ochromolopinae (e.g. Common, 1990: 321) but this is no longer maintained since the last group is probably hierarchically nested within the first (Dugdale et al., 1999). They are presently placed in their own superfamily but have previously been placed among the Yponomeutoidea or Copromorphoidea with which they share some features. Their systematic placement among the apoditrysian group ""Obtectomera"" (having pupal segments I-IV immobile) is however uncertain. They show some morphological similarities to the ""plume moths"" (Alucitoidea and Pterophoroidea), for example the wing fringe has similar groups of scales (Dugdale et al., 1999). There are also some similarities to Schreckensteinioidea, for example spiny legs and at least in some species an open-network cocoon. The genus Thambotricha from New Zealand may be the sister group of all other extant members. The most important genera are Epermenia, Ochromolopis and Gnathifera. The group has been extensively revised and catalogued by Dr Reinhard Gaedike (e.g. Gaedike, 1977, 1979).


== Identification ==
Epermeniidae are small narrow-winged moths, having a span of 7–20 mm, with conspicuous whorls of bristles on their legs, lacking spines on the abdomen unlike some similar moths. The smoothly scaled head bears no ocelli or ""chaetosemata"". They are most easily confused with Stathmopodinae (Oecophoridae), which unlike epermeniids have the tarsi of the forelegs and midlegs without the whorls of spines, and whose proboscis is scaled at the base. The projecting scale tufts on the inner margin of the hindwing is the easiest field character (Common, 1990).


== Distribution ==
Epermeniidae occur worldwide in both temperate and tropical regions and especially in montane areas, but are sparsely known from the Afrotropics. Gnathifera occurs from Australia to New Caledonia; Epermenia ranges from the Palaearctic to Indo-Australia and the Pacific islands.


== Behaviour ==
Epermeniidae are nocturnal as adults and well-camouflaged. They rest parallel to the surface with their wings held over their back in a tent-like manner (Robinson et al., 1994).


== Biology ==
The caterpillars feed inside almost any plant parts (fruits, seeds, galls, leaves or flowers), sometimes in a mine or sometimes exposed or under silk on the leaf surface; unlike some Lepidoptera the pupa is not extruded from the cocoon, and may be found in its fine open-network cocoon on the plant or amongst debris on the ground.


== Host plants ==
Many species in Europe feed on umbels of Apiaceae, and Epermenia chaerophyllella is a pest of cultivated species. Other species feed on the parasitic plant families Santalaceae (e.g. the Australian quandong moth) and Loranthaceae, or on Pinaceae, Pittosporaceae and Leguminosae.

Elachistidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Elachistidae are members of the Superfamily Gelechioidea. Worldwide in distribution, there are more than 400 known species that are mainly found in north temperate regions. There have been about 140 species described in America north of Mexico, but the true diversity of this family is likely much higher, as the elachistid fauna is virtually unexplored in large areas of the continent. These are tiny or small moths, wingspan 0.6-1.1 cm, with narrow, lancelike wings that are usually white, grey, or black with white markings. Larvae feed on leaves of grasses and sedges, and pupate in loose, meshlike cocoons or as naked pupae attached to plants or other objects by a silken girdle.",688
Elachistidae,family,wikipedia.org,"In fact, most of these moths appear to be either closer to the Oecophorinae and are hence nowadays usually included in the Oecophoridae (Depressariinae, ""Deuterogoniinae"", Hypertrophinae, Stenomatinae and perhaps the enigmatic Aeolanthes), or constitute quite basal lineages of gelechioids, neither closely related to Elachista nor to Oecophora, and hence best treated as independent families within the Gelechioidea (Agonoxenidae, Ethmiidae). The genus Coelopoeta is sometimes still placed here, but probably belongs in the Oecophorinae.
Consequently, the Elachistidae are essentially identical to the subfamily Elachistinae in the family's wide circumscription. The Agonoxenidae might perhaps belong here regardless, but even this is doubtful. Nonetheless, a considerable number of genera remain in the present family, and eventually it is likely that subdivisions will again be established (e.g. by raising some or all of the tribes proposed for the former Elachistinae to subfamily status).
A significant reduction of genera has been proposed, from the current mass of 20 genera to 3. The proposition was made on the premise of several distinguishing classifications, all of which are synapomorphies. Those include genital size and presence of digitate, adult abdomen segments without dorsal spines, absence of maxillary palpi and fronto-clypeal suture, and immobile abdominal segments in pupae and larvae. Various tribes were considered within the proposition, with most differentiation coming from genital structure.
In the modern, reduced description, the Elachistidae are small to very small moths (wingspans usually around 1 cm). Their wings appear feather-like due to the fine hair covering the wings' fringes, and the hindwings can be significantly reduced in area, essentially consisting of a small strip with a wide hairy fringe. The caterpillars are typically leaf miners or stem miners on Poales.",1911

Drepanidae,family,wikipedia.org,"The Drepanidae are a family of moths with about 660 species described worldwide. They are generally divided in three subfamilies, which share the same type of hearing organ. Thyatirinae, previously often placed in their own family, bear a superficial resemblance to Noctuidae. Many species in the drepanid family have a distinctively hook-shaped apex to the fore wing, leading to their common name of hook-tips.
The larvae of many species are very distinctive, tapering to a point at the tail and usually resting with both head and tail raised. They usually feed on the leaves of trees and shrubs, pupating between leaves spun together with silk.

Lyonetiidae,family,butterfliesandmoths.org,"The Lyonetiid Moths are very tiny moths with a wingspan of 0.4-1.1 cm. They have lancelike wings that end in narrow points. The base of their antennae is usually surrounded by an eye-cap. As larvae, they often skeletonize leaves, and they pupate in a ribbed, whitish cocoon formed along a twig of the food plant. The cocoon of each species is distinctive, sometimes distinctive enough that the species can be determined.",420
